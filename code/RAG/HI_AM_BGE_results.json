        "predicted_answer": "Loan deferment is a temporary postponement of monthly loan payments. It allows you to temporarily stop making payments on your debt without the interest continuing to accrue. In other words, a deferment allows you to skip payments for a certain period of time and not have to pay interest on the outstanding balance.",
        "ground_truth": "loan deferment allows you to take a break from making payments on your loans. what deferment looks like, though, can vary depending on the type of loan you have.",
        "retrieved_chunk": [
            "What is the difference between forbearance and deferment What is the difference between forbearance and deferment A loan deferment is a temporary postponement of monthly loan payments. For subsidized loans, accrued interest will automatically be paid by the Department of Education if the loan is deferred.",
            "What is deferment  In the context of loans, deferment often refers to a pause on payments during which interest does not continue to accrue. In other words, a deferment allows you to temporarily stop making payments on your debt without the interest continuing to pile up. The word deferral is sometimes used in the same way. Taking this option is sometimes called deferring a loan. In the student loan and mortgage examples above, if you were granted a deferment of your loan payments, you would still owe the same amount 10,000 or 250,000 whenever you were able to resume payments. Your loan would neither grow nor shrinkit would be temporarily frozen. Sometimes, lenders use the word deferment in other ways. For example, its sometimes used to refer to an option that follows a forbearance , in which the skipped payments are set aside to be paid after the rest of the loan has been paid. Like forbearance , the word deferment has other, more general meanings outside of finance, but it usually involves the postponement of something. Our finances depend heavily on another set of terms worth discussing inflation vs. deflation.",
            "Quick summary The word forbearance commonly refers to a temporary pause on loan payments that usually involves the loan balance continuing to accrue interest. A deferment , on the other hand, typically involves a temporary pause on loan payments without interest continuing to accrue.",
            "Deferment If you have a loan, especially a student loan or a mortgage , there may come a time when you arent able to keep up with your payments. But there are options when it comes to repayment relief, including one called a forbearance and one called a deferment .",
            "Our finances depend heavily on another set of terms worth discussing inflation vs. deflation. What is the difference between forbearance and deferment  Forbearance and deferment can both refer to temporary pauses on debt payment, but forbearance usually involves the continued accumulation of interest, while deferment does not."

Not only does it give you something else to keep an eye on as youre playing  what does that devil have in mind for the maze  it also plays around with the idea of a games UI in interesting ways. Theres the score, fine, and how many lives you have left, but then part of the stuff that drives the game is pretending to be mechanical the maze is only moving because of the trundling work of those monsters. Devil World feels very fresh to me. Its a game Ive known about for a long time, but now Ive played it, I feel like Im getting its playfulness directly transmitted, with no cobwebby time coming between the game design and its various fancies and then me on the other side of the screen."
