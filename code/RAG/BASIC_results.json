It was founded in 1904 4 to oversee international competition among the national associations of Belgium , Denmark , France , Germany , the Netherlands , Spain represented by the Madrid Football Club , Sweden , and Switzerland . Headquartered in Zürich , Switzerland, its membership now comprises 211 national associations . These national associations must also be members of one of the six regional confederations into which the world is divided CAF Africa, AFC Asia and Australia, UEFA Europe, CONCACAF North  Central America and the Caribbean, OFC Oceania, and CONMEBOL South America. FIFA outlines several objectives in its organizational statutes, including growing association football internationally, providing efforts to ensure it is accessible to everyone, and advocating for integrity and fair play. 5 It is responsible for the organization and promotion of association footballs major international tournaments , notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930, and the Womens World Cup which began in 1991. Although FIFA does not solely set the laws of the game , that being the responsibility of the International Football Association Board of which FIFA is a member, it applies and enforces the rules across all FIFA competitions. 6 All FIFA tournaments generate revenue from sponsorships in 2022, FIFA had revenues of over US  5.8 billion, ending the 20192022 cycle with a net positive of US1.2 billion, and cash reserves of over US3.9 billion. 7 Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and voterigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organizations decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine highranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering , wire fraud , and money laundering . On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who launched a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well. 8 9 10 Many officials were suspended by FIFAs ethics committee including Sepp Blatter 11 and Michel Platini . 12 In early 2017, reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the reelections 13 of both chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borbély and HansJoachim Eckert , during the FIFA congress in May 2017. 14 15 On 9 May 2017, following Infantinos proposal, 16 FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borbély and Eckert. 16 Together with the chairmen, 11 of 13 committee members were removed. FIFA has been suspected of corruption regarding the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup .",
            "32 The FIFA Mens World Rankings are updated monthly and rank each team based on their performance in international competitions, qualifiers, and friendly matches.

The Congress assembles in ordinary sessions once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. Congress makes decisions relating to FIFAs governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only Congress can pass changes to FIFAs statutes. The congress approves the annual report and decides on the acceptance of new national associations, and holds elections. Congress elects the President of FIFA , its general secretary, and the other members of the FIFA Council in the year following the FIFA World Cup . 33 FIFA Council  formerly called the FIFA Executive Committee and chaired by the president  is the organizations main decisionmaking body in the intervals of Congress. The council comprises 37 people the president 8 vicepresidents and 28 members from the confederations, with at least one of them being a woman. The executive committee is the body that decides which country will host the World Cup. The president and the general secretary are the main office holders of FIFA and are in charge of its daily administration, carried in by the general secretariat, with its staff of approximately 280 members. Gianni Infantino is the current president, elected on 26 February 2016 at an extraordinary FIFA Congress session after former president Sepp Blatter was suspended pending a corruption investigation . 34 35 FIFAs worldwide organizational structure also consists of several other bodies under the authority of the FIFA Council or created by Congress as standing committees. Among those bodies are the FIFA Emergency Committee, the FIFA Ethics Committee , the Finance Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Referees Committee. The FIFA Emergency Committee deals with all matters requiring immediate settlement in the time frame between the regular meetings of the FIFA Council . 36 37 The Emergency Committee consists of the FIFA president as well as one member from each confederation. 38 Emergency Committee decisions made are immediately put into legal effect, although they need to be ratified at the next Executive Committee meeting. 39 Administrative cost  edit  FIFA publishes its results according to International Financial Reporting Standards . The total compensation for the management committee in 2011 was 30 million for 35 people. Blatter, the only fulltime person on the committee, earned approximately two million Swiss francs, 1.2 million in salary, and the rest in bonuses. 40 41 42 A report in Londons The Sunday Times in June 2014 said the members of the committee had their salaries doubled from 100,000 to 200,000 during the year.

Grammy Award for Best New Artist Victoria Monét is the most recent recipient Country United States Presented by National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences First awarded 1960 Currently held by Victoria Monét  2024  Website grammy .com The Grammy Award for Best New Artist has been awarded since the 2nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1960, 1 but was not presented in 1967. Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were handed out, for records released in the previous year. The official guidelines are as follows For a new artist who releases, during the Eligibility Year, the first recording which establishes the public identity of that artist. Note that this is not necessarily the first album released by an artist for example, Shelby Lynne won the award in 2001 after having already released six albums over 13 years. 2 The Best New Artist award has a reputation for being given to artists whose music industry success ends up being shortlived it is sometimes asserted, with varying degrees of sincerity, that the award itself brings a curse. 3 4 This viewpoint was expressed by former Starland Vocal Band member Taffy Danoff in a 2002 interview for VH1 s 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders  We got two of the five Grammys  one was Best New Artist. So that was basically the kiss of death and I feel sorry for everyone whos gotten it since. 5 The category is also notable for being the only category in which a Grammy Award was vacated this occurred in 1990 after it was revealed that winners Milli Vanilli did not contribute their own vocals on their album Girl You Know Its True . 6 The award was not then given to another artist. 7 Further information  edit  Of the 62 acts who have won the award since its inception, 31 are solo female artists, 19 are duos or groups, and 12 are solo male artists. Of the solo male artists, half were given the award in its first decade since 1970, only six solo male artists have won the award, the most recent being Chance the Rapper in 2017. From 1997 to 2003, and again from 2018 to 2024, all the winners were solo female artists. Only five artists have won both Best New Artist and Album of the Year in the same year Bob Newhart in 1961, Christopher Cross in 1981, Lauryn Hill in 1999, Norah Jones in 2003, and Billie Eilish in 2020. Of these, Cross, Jones, and Eilish had songs winning Record of the Year and Song of the Year for the same year, with Cross as the sole songwriter, Eilish as cowriter, and Jones lacking songwriting credit, which therefore made her miss out on completing the single year big four Grammy achievement, a feat that only Cross and Eilish attained while Adele was the only artist to win all General field Grammys from separate occasions. Only two artists have lost Best New Artist yet won Album of the Year in the same year Vaughn Meader in 1963 and Alanis Morissette in 1996.",
            "17 In 2021, it was announced that the Nomination Review Committees would be disbanded, and the final nominees for best new artist would be decided by votes from members. 18 Starting in 2022, the number of nominees in the category increased to 10. 19 However, the decision to expand the number of nominees in this category was made 24 hours before the nominees were announced after an early version of the nominations list had already been circulated. This allowed Baby Keem and Arooj Aftab to be nominated as they were the artists that received the most votes besides the other eight nominees. 20 As of the 2024 ceremony , the number of nominees has been reduced to eight. 21 Rules changes  edit  Over the years, the eligibility rules for this category have changed several times. In 2010, Lady Gaga s exclusion from the Best New Artist category caused the Recording Academy to change eligibility requirements for the next ceremony. She was ineligible for the nomination because her hit  Just Dance  had been nominated in 2008. The new rule stated that an artist may be nominated as long as that artist has not previously released an entire album and has subsequently not won a Grammy. 22 23 In June 2016, the Grammy organization amended the Best New Artist rules once again, to remove the album barrier given current trends in how new music and developing artists are released and promoted. 24 To be eligible in the category of Best New Artist, the artist, duo, or group Must have released a minimum of five singlestracks or one album until 2020 there was a maximum of 30 singlestracks or three albums, but this maximum limit was removed for the 2021 awards season May not have entered into this category more than three times, including as a performing member of an established group. Must have achieved a breakthrough into the public consciousness and impacted the musical landscape during the eligibility period. These new rules were put in effect with the 59th Annual Grammy Awards . The category was then expanded to include eight nominees in 2019 . 25 Starting in 2021, screening committees were charged with determining whether the artist had attained a breakthrough or prominence prior to the eligibility year. Such a determination would result in disqualification. 26 Recipients  edit  1960s  edit  Inaugural winner Bobby Darin went on to score 22 top 40 hits in America, including five top three hits and a number one song. Bob Newhart won the Grammy for his work as a comedian. The same year he also won the Album of the Year award. He is the only nonmusician to win this award. Peter Nero left was the first jazz musician to win the award. The Swingle Singers were the first group and Foreign act to win the Award and are still active today. The Beatles Members John Lennon , Paul McCartney , Ringo Starr , and George Harrison , clockwise from top left, would go on to become the best selling band of all time . Bobbie Gentry became the first woman to win the award in 1968. José Feliciano is the first Hispanic and blind artist to win the award.

            "Princess Gabbara  GRAMMYs  Feb 20, 2024  0637 pm A chance meeting changed Rihanna s life. The singer was just 15 years old when she met producer Evan Rogers, who was vacationing with his wife in Barbados. Rogers recognized Rihannas potential, and invited her to an audition in his hotel suite. Shortly after her 16th birthday, Rihanna left her home country for the U.S. to record a demo, which included her breakthrough hit Pon de Replay. The demo found its way into JayZ s hands, and Hov signed the teen artist to Def Jam and the label expedited her 2005 debut album, aptly titled Music of the Sun . When I left Barbados, I didnt look back, Rihanna told Entertainment Weekly in 2007. I wanted to do what I had to do to succeed, even if it meant moving to America. Twenty years later, Rihanna is a renowned entertainerturnedmogul. She has sold over 40 million albums worldwide, garnered over 12 billion Spotify streams, achieved 14 Billboard Hot 100 charttoppers, and won nine GRAMMY Awards. Even her business ventures have been a massive success, as her Fenty Beauty brand is worth 2.8 billion. Though its been close to a decade since Rihannas last studio album, 2016s ANTI , she reminded the world of her reign with her 2023 Super Bowl halftime show  which also marked her first time taking the stage in five years. Performing hit after hit while unveiling a baby bump, her 13minute set became one of the mostwatched halftime shows of all time with over 121 million viewers. In honor of Rihannas 36th birthday on Feb. 20, GRAMMY.com is revisiting the monstrous hits, ambitious projects, browraising visuals, and iconic collabs that propelled her to international stardom  and why its all put her in a league of her own. A New Island Girl In Town True to her Carribean heritage, Rihannas dancehallinspired debut single Pon de Replay earned the then 17yearold Barbados native her first entry on the Hot 100 at an impressive No. 2. Her official introduction to the world also hit No. 1 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart she boasts 33 on the tally, second behind only the Queen of Pop herself, Madonna . Followup single If Its Lovin That You Want stalled at No. 36 on the Hot 100, but still whetted fans appetite  as did her debut album, Music of the Sun , which is mostly comprised of dancepop and dancehall tracks with hints of RB like Willing to Wait. Plus, her reimagining of Dawn Penns 1994 reggae classic You Dont Love Me No, No, No is still so fun to listen to after all these years. A mere eight months later, Rihannas sophomore effort, 2006s A Girl Like Me , arrived to an eager audience. Defying the sophomore slump, she celebrated her first No. 1 with the ubiquitous lead single SOS, which famously samples Soft Cells 1981 hit, Tainted Love. While A Girl Like Me is filled with highenergy, danceable tracks including the nostalgic Break It Off with Sean Paul , Rihannas second single was the melodramatic ballad Unfaithful. Penned by thenlabelmate NeYo , Unfaithful peaked at No. 6 on the Hot 100. More importantly, it showed a different side to Rihanna, proving that she could channel deep emotion when the performance calls for it. It also marked Rihannas first time veering away from her girl next door image, as the songs subject matter deals with infidelity. A Girl Like Me contains many fan favorites, from the laidback We Ride to standouts Dem Haters and Kisses Dont Lie. The latter is a reggaerock hybrid that sounds like a catalyst for some of Rihannas edgier tunes like Breakin Dishes from 2007s Good Girl Gone Bad era. Touching balladsFinal Goodbye and A Million Miles Away showcase her voice beautifully, foreshadowing later bigvocal numbers like Love on the Brain. An Icon In The Making Rihanna was a familiar face by 2007, but with the arrival of her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad , she graduated from cookiecutter pop star to bonafide icon. Produced by Tricky Stewart , the LPs juggernaut lead single Umbrella featuring JayZ skyrocketed to No. 1 in 17 countries.",

As a film that is trying to make its share from the popularity of the Fast and Furious franchise, Fast and Fierce shows a complete lack of understanding of what makes Fast and Furious so popular and successful. The writing is shocking. At times it even dips into the same territory as The Room but in a way that is embarrassing than endearing. The acting isnt very good either, it gives the impression that all the actors are amateurs and that this is their first time acting, and whoever directed the film chose their first takes of every scene they did. What makes Fast and Furious so exciting to watch is that the films, during the races, are very visually stylized. In Fast and Fierce, we have shaky cam, fast editing that sometimes breaks continuity, and shots of actors who dont look like they know what they are supposed to be reacting to. I draw comparisons to Fast and the Furious, not only because of its alternative title Fast and Fierce, but also because they even use the line I live life a quarter mile at a time so its begging for the comparison. The film ends with a weird interjection that is out of place and in a situation that does not really give much resolution to anything. The romance is forced and so cliche that the film would have been better off without it. I didnt have high expectations for this film and, indeed, it lived up to those quite low expectations. This is easily the kind of film you can enjoy with friends if you all enjoy watching cheaply made, imitations of big budget Hollywood films. There is entertainment value with this, but its better with friends. Not so bad its good, but its campy, hammy, and corny enough for a bad movie night. 14 out of 14 found this helpful.

The race is 1,000 miles from Mexico to LA. I love films with Death Race in the title. But this was more like a three car Gumball Rally. No points for killing Mexicans. The plot was messed up as if they winged it. Why Eastern European models in Mexico And how did Nelson get to Arizona in a pickup truck ahead of his brother driving over 100 MPH with at least 3 or 4 overdrive gears Guide Fword.

            "Almost every Lakers legend has beaten the Celtics in the Finals at some point, and James doing so would help cement him as one of the greatest players in team history despite his short tenure in Los Angeles. The Celtics were LeBrons greatest rival in the Eastern Conference for the first 15 seasons of his career. He faced them in the postseason seven times with Cleveland and Miami. No matter who he faces or what the outcome, this season and playoff run will be another line in a lengthy and historic resume for LeBron. It has been over three decades since a player led a team to the Finals 10 different times, and it could be quite a bit longer before we see it done again.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences first recognized the technical contributions of special effects to movies at its inaugural dinner in 1928, presenting a plaque for Best Engineering Effects to the first Best Picture Oscar winner, the World War I flying drama Wings . Producer David O. Selznick , then production head at RKO Studios, petitioned the Academy Board of Governors to recognize the work of animator Willis OBrien for his groundbreaking work on 1933s King Kong 1933 . But it was not until 1938 when a film was actually recognized for its effects work, when a Special Achievement Award for Special Effects was given to the Paramount film Spawn of the North . The following year, Best Special Effects became a recognized category, although on occasion the Academy has chosen to honor a single film outright rather than nominate two or more films. From 1939 to 1963, it was an award for a films visual effects as well as audio effects, so usually it was given to two persons, although some years only one or the other type of effect was recognised. In 1964, it was given only for visual effects, and the following year the name of the category was changed to Best Special Visual Effects . Between 1972 and 1977, there was no specific award for visual effects. As such work was awarded within the umbrella award called Special Achievement Academy Award. In 1977, a specific award category for visual effects was reintroduced with the current name, Best Visual Effects, although until 1995, visual effects could for some years continue to be given within the Special Achievement Academy Award instead. Which 1990 was the last year there was no official nominations, but instead a special achievement given.

He is best known for owning and operating The House of Chanel perfume company. As of this writing, Gerard is one of the 20 richest people in the world. His brother Alain is also worth 45 billion. Gerard Wertheimer was born in Paris, France in April 1951. He is the coowner of House of Chanel with his brother Alain Wertheimer . House of Chanel was cofounded by his grandfather Pierre Wertheimer. The company owns nonChanel brands like Tanner Krolle, Holland  Holland, and more. Gerard and Alain Wertheimer also own French vineyards including Chateau Canon in SaintEmilion and Chateau RauzanSegla in Margaux. The brothers are equestrians who inherited a thoroughbred horse racing stable called La Presle Farm. Gerard Wertheimer graduated from the University of Paris. House of Chanel was founded in 1909 by Coco Chanel . The brands products include haute couture, perfume, jewelry, and accessories and posted a revenue of 11 billion in 2018 with more than 20,000 employees worldwide. Coco Chanel Back in the late 1800s, Ernest Wertheimer moved from Alsace, France to Paris. He bought the company Bourjois, a theatrical makeup company that produced the very first dry rouge in the world. Ernests sons Pierre and Paul took over the family business in 1917 and just three years later, the company was the largest and most successful cosmetic and fragrance company in France. The turning point on the path to even greater success came when Pierre met Coco Chanel in the 1920s. They became business partners. In 1924 Pierre and Coco created Parfums Chanel when Coco Chanel came to the conclusion that it was the right time to launch her signature fragrance, Chanel No. 5, to a larger and wider base of customers. Prior to the agreement with Wertheimer, Chanel No. 5 was only available in Chanels boutique. Coco leveraged Pierres expertise in retail as well as his knowledge of the American market and his financial resources. Pierre took a 70 stake in Parfums Chanel for his part in financing and marketing Chanels perfume. For a 10 stake in Parfums Chanel, Coco licensed her name to the company and didnt take part in any of the business operations. She was, after all, a designer at heart. However, as time went on, Coco was unhappy with the deal shed made with Pierre and attempted to regain control of Parfums Chanel. She sued the Wertheimers in the mid 1930s and lost. When the Nazis descended on Paris during World War II, Chanel contacted German officials and told them that the Wertheimers, a Jewish family, owned her perfume and as an Aryan, it was her legal right under the laws that then required the property of all Jewish families to be seized. However, the Wertheimers were one step ahead of both the Nazis and the shrewd Coco Chanel. They had seen the Nazi mandates coming and moved to New York in 1940. Not only that, but they turned over full legal control of Parfums Chanel to a French businessman and Christian, Felix Amiot. When World War II ended in the favor of the Allies, Amiot turned Parfums Chanel back over to the Wertheimers. When Coco Chanel died in 1971, the family bought her out.

From left, Gérard and Alain Wertheimer at the Prix de Diane Longines horse race in 2011 in Chantilly, France. Photo WireImage Their wealth stems from the fact that in 1925, their grandfather Pierre Wertheimer and his brother Paul struck a deal with Gabrielle Coco Chanel , who was already famous for her successful fashion business.

Coco Chanels Nazi leanings Fashion designer Coco Chanel tried to wrest control of Chanel from Alain and Gerards grandfather and his brother, who owned 50 per cent of the company in the 1940s. Photo Getty Images Chanel was a known Nazi sympathiser who dated a Gestapo spy and appears to have worked as an informant during World War II, though she was never charged, according to PBS. In 1941, Chanel tried to legally wrest control of the company from Pierre Wertheimer. The Wertheimers were Jewish and at that time owned over 50 per cent of the fashion house, so Chanel attempted to use a law that banned Jews from owning businesses, according to The Guardian.

Now Ill admit that I had no proof whatsoever, but, after I watched Hell Swarm , I had a strong suspicion that it was intended as a pilot for a TV series. After all, it spends a lot of time setting up the basic situation and characters, offers a fairly large sort of canvas to work with, and leaves the possibility at the end that the story will continue. And low and behold, Ive just turned up a Starlog interview with Tim Matheson, who directed and costars in this one, and they did have that option in mind. Now Ive reviewed several movies lately which were made for the United Paramount Networks regular movie slot. As youd expect, they werent exactly exceptional  in fact, several of them would later move to the Sci Fi still orthographically unchallenged Network. And, as one can also say about the films made for Sci Fi, a few of them have proved interesting. But Hell Swarm doesnt really belong in that category. Now, you may have guessed that this is a movie about swarms of killer bees. And you would be right. Except that it isnt. Well, not much, at least. The bees are there, all right. Theyre even carrying a nasty plague, so those who get stung die quickly. And there is actually one town which wiped out by a handful of bees as a test. Offscreen. We do get to see that there are big tanks full of bees, however. Mind you, I dont see this as a big problem as bees might be scary in theory, but they are one of the least cinematic monsters on record. No one has really made them look particularly scary, despite the fact that a huge swarm of bees is objectively terrifying. The problem is that, in a big swarm, they just look like littledots. Admittedly, there have been quite a few killer bee movies, several of which Ive reviewed here. Some of them are actually pretty good. But even they struggle with this fundamental problem. However, this is really an alien invasion movie. Billy Sabbath has just been executed for a crime he did not commit. Which leaves him free to join a secret group out to get the bodysnatching creeps who framed him. Except for the minor problem that he really doesnt want to join them, and would rather get in touch with his wife. Now, these aliens, if thats the right term for them, were here before us and are called the Phylum. I think. Some online sources call them by the Biblical term Nephilim, but, if theyre right, I didnt hear it that way. I dont suppose it matters, though, as this is familiar territory theyre planning to reclaim the Earth, and are trying to rebuild their numbers and launch their deadly swarm. And, of course, although they may look like us, they are stronger and faster. They always are. Tim Matheson plays Bluhdorn, the leader of the alien fighting, socalled Global Freight Company and gives him a nice, brutal edge. He drops out of the story partway through, and it doesnt look like hell be back, but somehow I have a sneaking suspicion he would have turned up again if they did a series. It wouldnt have been too hard after all, like most of the things it would have cost them an arm and a leg to do, his departure happens off screen. Oh, well. I thought this would be a TV bee movie about aliens unleashing a deadly bee swarm upon the world. I guess it is, more or less, but without actually being one. Its okay for what it is, but not as good as the better films UPN made at the time, like their eccentric but fun comedy, Monster 1999 . Instead, were talking something far more routine. Oh, well."

The Animatrix was overseen and approved by the Wachowskis, who only wrote four of the segments themselves but did not direct any of them much of the project was developed by notable figures from the world of anime. 214 In March 2017, Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise with Zak Penn in talks to write a treatment and interest in getting Michael B. Jordan attached to star. According to The Hollywood Reporter neither the Wachowskis nor Joel Silver were involved with the endeavor, although the studio would like to get at minimum the blessing of the Wachowskis. 215 On August 20, 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairman Toby Emmerich officially announced that a fourth Matrix film was in the works, with Keanu Reeves and CarrieAnne Moss set to reprise their roles as Neo and Trinity respectively. 216 The Matrix Resurrections was released on December 22, 2021, in theaters and on HBO Max.

It could happen sooner, especially if Netflixs games becomes something it thinks it can charge more for. But for now, it seems like well be waiting a little bit before Netflix pricing goes up again.

I fell asleep 3 times during this movie. I was waiting for it to get better or at least watchable but it never got to either point. The length of this movie is barely just over an hour but it is an hour of my life that I want back. Hey, at least one thing good came out of it, I only wasted a dollar rental.

An extremely bad, agonizingly unfunny comedy concerning urban family man Charles Grodin taking the wife and kids on vacation to an island resort, and not getting what he expected. Grainy, grimy mess is a most uncomfortable viewing experience. The movie actually manages to look worse than your average TV feature, with the limp writing at a sophomoric level and a direction that seems nonexistent. Grodin, in desperationmode, is obviously being wasted, but supporting performers Jon Lovitz, Mario Van Peebles and Phil Hartman dont even seem to take notice.

BrettErikJohnson 9 February 2005 Warning Spoilers How can there be screenwriters when this film doesnt even have a real plot Charles Grodin plays George, a guy who sells chairs for a living. He tells his best client that he is fat and the client takes his business elsewhere. The owner of the business is furious and George decides its a good time to go on vacation. He takes his family to some fleabag resort that he knows nothing about. Let the laughs begin Heh. All of the employees at the resort are strange andor gay. The employees that Phil Hartman and Mario Van Peebles play are both homosexuals for the sole purpose of having Grodins character show his disdain for them. Throw in Jon Lovitz and Megan Mullally and you would think that the supporting cast alone would at least make this watchable. You would be so, SO wrong to assume that though. Well, I guess I can wrap this up already since there isnt much to discuss in terms of the plot. George and his wife smoke some pot, his wife also takes some hallucinogenic mushrooms, a few women take their tops off and everything culminates in a massive shootout with some rebel guerrillas...or something. Did I mention that this takes place around Christmas Sorry, its easy to forget since it is specifically pointed out at the beginning of the film and then virtually ignored for the rest of the story. My advice to you is to ignore this entire film. 110 8 out of 13 found this helpful. Was this review helpful Sign in to vote. Permalink 3 10 The resort is cheap and nasty, like the movie Groverdox 10 May 2016 Warning Spoilers Last Resort involves an island retreat that seems cut price and crappy less as a plot development than a necessity of the movies cut price and crappy production values. You arent thinking, hey, that accommodation really sucks, youre thinking, of course it does. They couldnt afford to make a resort that sucks in a funny way. Part of the problem is that you never get an idea of the place as an actual location, which could be due to the lack of suitable shooting locations afforded by the budget. What locations there are seem completely separate from each other, and none of the staff are distinct characters outside of some weird tics. What is unforgivable about this is that this movie stars both Jon Lovitz AND Phil Hartman. Neither are given much to do, or anything funny. They may not have had much money to make the movie, but they had comedic gold in their hands with the talent they were working with."

        "query": "when did sally become the first film to be made entirely in the technicolor process 3?",
        "predicted_answer": "1929",
        "ground_truth": "invalid question",
        "retrieved_chunk": [
            "The new process would last until the last Technicolor feature film was produced in 1955. A Threestrip Technicolor camera from the 1930s Technicolors advantage over most early naturalcolor processes was that it was a subtractive synthesis rather than an additive one unlike the additive Kinemacolor and Chronochrome processes, Technicolor prints did not require any special projection equipment. Unlike the additive Dufaycolor process, the projected image was not dimmed by a lightabsorbing and obtrusive mosaic color filter layer. Very importantly, compared to competing subtractive systems, Technicolor offered the best balance between high image quality and speed of printing. The Technicolor Process 4 camera, manufactured to Technicolors detailed specifications by Mitchell Camera Corporation, contained a beam splitter consisting of a partially reflecting surface inside a splitcube prism , color filters , and three separate rolls of blackandwhite film hence the threestrip designation. The beam splitter allowed onethird of the light coming through the camera lens to pass through the reflector and a green filter and form an image on one of the strips, which therefore recorded only the greendominated third of the spectrum . The other twothirds was reflected sideways by the mirror and passed through a magenta filter, which absorbed green light and allowed only the red and blue thirds of the spectrum to pass. Behind this filter were the other two strips of film, their emulsions pressed into contact face to face. The front film was a redblind orthochromatic type that recorded only the blue light. On the surface of its emulsion was a redorange coating that prevented blue light from continuing on to the redsensitive panchromatic emulsion of the film behind it, which therefore recorded only the reddominated third of the spectrum. Each of the three resulting negatives was printed onto a special matrix film. After processing, each matrix was a nearly invisible representation of the series of film frames as gelatin reliefs, thickest and most absorbent where each image was darkest and thinnest where it was lightest. Each matrix was soaked in a dye complementary to the color of light recorded by the negative printed on it cyan for red, magenta for green, and yellow for blue see also CMYK color model for a technical discussion of color printing. A single clear strip of blackandwhite film with the soundtrack and frame lines printed in advance was first treated with a mordant solution and then brought into contact with each of the three dyeloaded matrix films in turn, building up the complete color image. Each dye was absorbed, or imbibed, by the gelatin coating on the receiving strip rather than simply deposited onto its surface, hence the term dye imbibition. Strictly speaking, this is a mechanical printing process most closely related to Woodburytype and very loosely comparable to offset printing or lithography , 21 and not a photographic one, as the actual printing does not involve a chemical change caused by exposure to light. During the early years of the process, the receiver film was preprinted with a 50 blackandwhite image derived from the green strip, the socalled Key, or K, record. This procedure was used largely to cover up fine edges in the picture where colors would mix unrealistically also known as fringing . This additional black increased the contrast of the final print and concealed any fringing. However, overall colorfulness was compromised as a result. In 1944, Technicolor had improved the process to make up for these shortcomings and the K record was eliminated. Early adoption by Disney  edit  Kalmus convinced Walt Disney to shoot one of his Silly Symphony cartoons, Flowers and Trees 1932, in Process 4, the new threestrip process. Seeing the potential in fullcolor Technicolor, Disney negotiated an exclusive contract for the use of the process in animated films that extended to September 1935. 22 Other animation producers, such as the Fleischer Studios and the Ub Iwerks studio, were shut out  they had to settle for either the twocolor Technicolor systems or use a competing process such as Cinecolor . Flowers and Trees was a success with audiences and critics alike, and won the first Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film . All subsequent Silly Symphonies from 1933 on were shot with the threestrip process. One Silly Symphony , Three Little Pigs 1933, engendered such a positive audience response that it overshadowed the feature films with which it was shown. Hollywood was buzzing about color film again.

            "Critics Consensus The Wolf of Wall Street is Certified Fresh  Rotten Tomatoes Home Top Box Office Tickets  Showtimes DVD  Streaming TV News SIGN UP LOG IN Jester McGree Logout Whats the Tomatometer RT Critics Home Box Office TV DVD MORE News Movies TV Shows News Tickets  Showtimes Trending on RT Critics Consensus Critics Consensus The Wolf of Wall Street is Certified Fresh Plus, Walter Mitty is sincere but uneven, Grudge Match and 47 Ronin lose the battle, Mandela is wellacted, and Believe was not screened for critics. by Tim Ryan  December 23, 2013  Comments TAGGED AS Certified Fresh Merry Christmas This week at the movies, weve got a financial fraudster  The Wolf of Wall Street , starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill  a timid daydreamer  The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty , starring Ben Stiller and Kristen Wiig  a pair of aging prizefighters  Grudge Match , starring Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro  a legendary warrior  47 Ronin , starring Keanu Reeves and Hiroyuki Sanada  a pop music sensation the documentary Justin Biebers Believe  and a human rights hero  Mandela Long Walk to Freedom , starring Idris Elba and Naomie Harris . What do the critics have to say The Wolf of Wall Street 80 Martin Scorsese knows how to capture the vicarious allure of criminality better than just about any other filmmaker. Critics say hes in fine form with The Wolf of Wall Street , a slick, sleek, and surprisingly funny tale of financial fraud that features a riveting performance from Leonardo DiCaprio. The film follows the rise of Jordan Belfort DiCaprio, the founder of a boiler room that sold worthless stocks to naïve customers. Belforts illgotten gains finance a staggering level of conspicuous debauchery, but hes shrewd enough to stay one step ahead of the government  for a while, anyway. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Wolf of Wall Street has the hyperkinetic energy youd expect from Scorsese, but what distinguishes it from past triumphs is its wild, ribald sense of humor. The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty 52 For all its evocative detail, James Thurbers 1939 short story The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is pretty brief, so it takes an imagination worthy of the title character to extend it to feature film length. Critics say Ben Stillers fantasy world looks great and has an optimistic tone, but its story often feels episodic and tonally uneven. Stiller stars as a reverieprone Life magazine photo editor with problems at work hes derided by his boss, hes got an unrequited crush on a coworker Kristen Wiig, and he cant find an image thats set to run in the next issue. He escapes into a globespanning fantasyland of his own creation  which might be just the thing that snaps him out of his rut. The pundits say that The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is wellmeaning and ambitious, but it pushes its emotional buttons too hard to make up for a slight story. Grudge Match 31 Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro played two of cinemas most iconic boxers, and Grudge Match purports to be a lighthearted fantasy bout between Rocky Balboa and Jake The Raging Bull LaMotta. Unfortunately, critics say its more tomato can than contender  a film with a promising premise that rarely punches above its weight. Thirty years after hanging up the gloves after splitting their two matchups, bitter rivals Henry Razor Sharp Stallone and Billy The Kid McDonnen De Niro have a fisticuffsfilled reunion while performing motion capture for a video game. When news of their punchup spreads, the two fighters agree to a longdelayed rubber match  and a lot more than pride is on the line. The pundits say Grudge Match is sporadically funny but surprisingly lumbering, its strong cast largely mired in a plot thats overrun with clichés. 47 Ronin 16 From the silent era to the present, the tale of the 47 Ronin has inspired some of Japans greatest filmmakers. Now it gets a bigbudget Western adaptation , but unfortunately, critics say the human element gets lost under a barrage of overblown CGI effects. When a disgraced feudal lord is compelled to commit suicide after a confrontation with a corrupt official, his disgraced followers a group that includes an orphaned swashbuckler played by Keanu Reeves. The pundits say 47 Ronin is a surprisingly dull fantasy adventure, one that leaves its talented international cast stranded within one dimensional roles.",
            "The film goes on the psychological side when the story goes forward even when something is about to happen for what you didnt expect even towards the end. The twist in the third act is actually incredible when you least expected. I think what you may know or havent know is that this is the only movie of the partnership between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio that failed to receive any Oscar nominations. Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed and The Wolf of Wall Street all received Oscar nominations, including for Best Picture. Oh, well, at least they enjoyed the film very, very much. Nothing more to say about Shutter Island apart from what I said about the twist ending. Discover it and you will love it. Show Less Show More Flag this review Daniel G Dec 7, 2023 Shutter Island left me wanting more. The movies slow pace and confusing plot twists made it feel like a drag... Leonardo DiCaprios performance was solid, but even he couldnt save the movie from its convoluted storyline. The constant sense of suspense became tedious, and the big reveal at the end left me underwhelmed. I gave it a score of 210, it falls short in delivering an engaging and satisfying experience, leaving me with a sense of disappointment rather than excitement...

All rights reserved. Ben Affleck to Run for Office Probably Not By Elizabeth Hartfield December 21, 2012 Ben Affleck has been an increasingly popular presence in the political realm as of late. Earlier this week, he testified on Capitol Hill about security in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and recently his name has come up as a possible contender in the impending Massachusetts special election to fill the seat to be vacated by John Kerrys appointment as secretary of state . Affleck, 40, grew up in Cambridge, Mass. But it turns out running for political office might be a stretch too far for the actor and activist. In an interview with GQ, Affleck had some pretty harsh words for the American political system, including toxic, poisonous and inappropriate laced with expletives before them. I have gotten myself involved with politics, actually fairly in a pretty deep way, only to find that it really just took the wind out of my sails, he said. You know, it was much more interesting from the outside than from the inside. Its worth noting that Affleck appears to dance around the question Have you ever had serious considerations about running for office I have never had a serious conversation. Not really, he said. I could tell you but then I cant say what it is. For those hoping for a Ben Affleck vs. Scott Brown showdown this summer, dont abandon all hope yet.

All Rights Reserved Ben Affleck Shares Harsh Words For Republicans NEWS EXCLUSIVES ROYALS BEAUTY STYLE WELLNESS LOVE LIVING POLITICS ENTERTAINMENT FEATURES News Ben Affleck Shares Harsh Words For Republicans lev radinShutterstock By Linda DiProperzio  Dec. 8, 2021 114 pm EST Ben Affleck is most known as a successful writer, director and actor, winning Oscars for Good Will Hunting and Argo per IndieWire . He has also been in the tabloid headlines in 2021 due to his rekindled relationship with Jennifer Lopez . While he doesnt always like to discuss his personal life, he has been more than happy to share his political views throughout the years. What I will say about it is that its so disappointing, he told The Hill about the 2016 presidential election. When you go around the world and you travel to places that dont have a functioning democracy  and theres still so many places like this, where people are sacrificing and striving and struggling just to have freedom of speech, just to voteand you see what we seem to be squandering this election year. Despite his feelings, Affleck has expressed an interest in running for office one day, explaining to The New York Times that theres something really noble in public service via Boston Magazine . He went on to joke that because Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, I, all of a sudden, became qualified to run for president. And even his exwife, Jennifer Garner , believes Affleck might get into politics one day. Right now Ben feels like he can do more good for people politically from outside the system ... Would I be surprised if one day he did go into politics No. But not now, she told Allure via The Guardian  in 2013. Ben Affleck is concerned about our democracy TinseltownShutterstock Although he might not be ready to run for office, Ben Affleck had a lot to say about the voting process at a virtual fundraiser, where he appeared with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Attorney General Eric Holder, and Blackish star Tracee Ellis Ross to tackle topics including voting rights and gerrymandering, which Affleck warned can lead to very serious consequences for our democracy via The Hill . It leads to hyperpartisan politics where special interests rule and party extremists are incentivized instead of common sense and finding common ground and compromise, and a lot of this were seeing in our country today, he explained, adding that some Republicans want to dodge the consequences for their actions. This isnt the first time Affleck has expressed his opinion on Republicans. In 2013, he admitted to Playboy via HuffPost  he even has a hard time watching actors he knows support the GOP. When I watch a guy I know is a big Republican, part of me thinks, I probably wouldnt like this person if I met him, or we would have different opinions. That s fogs the mind when you should be paying attention and be swept into the illusion. Recommended"

Paparazzi Isnt it wild that this track off The Fame , the first of Gagas to explicitly explore her obsession with fame and notoriety, only peaked at No. 6 And yes, that is True Blood s Alexander Skarsgard in the iconique music video, which served as a prequel to the visual of another track a little higher up on this list. 8.

Photograph Stephen LovekinGetty Images Following her triumphant One World Together at Home charity concert  and before her album Chromatica  we rate the best of Stefani Germanottas gloriously OTT pop by Michael Cragg Thu 23 Apr 2020 07.30 EDT Last modified on Fri 20 Oct 2023 05.39 EDT Share 30. The Cure A standalone single that came out of the early sessions for the 2018 soundtrack A Star Is Born , The Cure pinches too liberally from the tropicaltinged Spotify sound of the time, but under the twinkly synths sits a heartfelt lyric about the healing power of love. Premiered at Coachella in 2017, it was dedicated not only to her fans, but also to a close friend who had cancer. 29. GUY The German EDM producer Zedd helps concoct a ludicrous melange of grinding synths, house breakdowns and vaudeville on the third single from 2013s chaotic album Artpop . Lyrically, Gaga explores the power moves behind specific sexual positions GUY stands for Girl Under You, then ruins the whole thing with this clunker Love me, love me, please retweet. 28. Speechless While 2008s debut album The Fame teased the idea of Gaga the megastar, 2009s eighttrack spinoff The Fame Monster cemented it. As its only conventional ballad, Speechless sticks out like a sore thumb. But its slurred, whiskeysoaked vocals and overthetop 70s rock production lend it a knowingly playful edge. Also during those early hiNRG, hitpacked shows, it was the perfect excuse for a barloo break. 27. John Wayne Camp cowboy fantasy ... watch the video for John Wayne. For the majority of 2016s album Joanne , Gaga swapped leotardsporting, highdrama dancepop for illfitting, smokedamaged plaidrock. Out went the likes of Zedd and Madeon  in came Mark Ronson and Father John Misty . Thankfully a hint of the old Gaga can be found in the chugging groove of the camp cowboy fantasy John Wayne. 26. Gypsy Artpop found Gaga careening between genres with more than a hint of desperation, but she finds space to breathe on the skyscraping Gypsy. What starts out as a muted piano ballad balloons into a joyous, galloping Europop stomper, complete with a central lyric about the loneliness of fame that doesnt make your eyes roll out of their sockets. View image in fullscreen A different cut ... Gagas famous meat dress. Photograph BDGRex Features 25. Ill Never Love Again Referencing the uberballads Without You and All By Myself, this tearjerking closer from A Star Is Born is given the full Whitney Houston treatment by Gaga, who doesnt let a single syllable go unadorned. One for the antipop brigade who remain unconvinced about her vocal prowess. 24. Heavy Metal Lover With its central synth riff and its lyrical reference in the bridge, the throbbing, hornedup Heavy Metal Lover is the cooler older sister to the eagertoplease Born This Way from the homonymous album. I want your whiskey mouth all over my blond south, coos Gaga, before seemingly reading from a Countryfile voiceover script as she intones Dirty pony, I cant wait to hose you down. 23. You and I Mark Taylor Remix You and I originally appeared on the setlist for the Monster Ball tour in early 2011 as a contemplative piano ballad."

            "When we arrived, we didnt have a hit record or anything going for us. However, in October of that same year, sales of The Rolling Stones records started to pick up. Their single Time Is on My Side reached 6 on the US charts and the group decided to return to America. In October 1964, the band headlined the music film The T.A.M.I. Show, singing their first Number One hit in the UK, Its All Over Now. With their popularity finally growing in the United States, The Rolling Stones took a lesson from the Beatles and Oldham booked them on The Ed Sullivan Show. The Rolling Stones first appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show on October 25, 1964. They had just released their third album, 12 X 5, and there was no better way to promote it. Ed introduced the band and told the audience that they would be performing in both halves of the show. With that, adoring fans began screaming, and the curtain rose to reveal The Rolling Stones taking their place on stage. The band kicked the night off with the Chuck Berry classic, Around  Around, and a young, shaggyhaired Mick Jagger danced across the stage to the girls delight. The screams lasted throughout the entire song, continuing even after it finished and the curtain had dropped. Ed attempted to introduce the next act, but the sustained shrieks muffled his attempts. He slowly grew impatient and had to tell the audience to be Quiet multiple times. The Rolling Stones came back to close that evenings show with their hit, Time Is on My Side. Once again, Mick Jagger had to sing over the shrieks of the raucous and unruly crowd. The performance put Jaggers charisma on full display as he gave engaging looks to the crowd and really seemed to be singing directly to individuals sitting in the audience. Following the song, Ed prodded the audience, Come on, let them hear it Sullivan ended up getting more than he bargained for as the crowd of youngsters screamed all the way through his chat with Jagger and his announcement of the following weeks guests. That evenings show brought The Rolling Stones national attention and helped generated over one million dollars in ticket sales for the bands fall concert tour. Although The Rolling Stones first performance on The Ed Sullivan Show was great for the bands popularity as well as for CBSs ratings, Sullivan was reticent to book them again. Following The Stones first performance, Ed supposedly declared, I promise you theyll never be back on our show. It took me 17 years to build this show and Im not going to have it destroyed in a matter of weeks. He had had enough of how worked up the crowds had become, and he thought the band was unkempt. When the Stones manager tried to change Sullivans mind he was sent a response from Ed reading, We were deluged with mail protesting the untidy appearanceclothes and hair of your Rolling Stones. Before even discussing the possibility of a contract, I would like to learn from you, whether your young men have reformed in the matter of dress and shampoo. Whatever was said in response to that note worked as The Rolling Stones were back on The Ed Sullivan Show stage several months later. On May 2, 1965 Ed Sullivan introduced The Rolling Stones to perform The Last Time, which would be the first time they sang a JaggerRichards original on the show. Next followed the bluesy Little Red Rooster, and Someone to Love. The audience, while still raucous and enthusiastic, was far more tame for the bands second appearanceas were The Stones themselves, who spruced up for the show, even donning sports jackets to help clean up their image. The Rolling Stones returned for their third Sullivan gig on February 13th, 1966. The rockers opened with a lively rendition of their first international Number One hit I Cant Get No Satisfaction. Throughout the performance the camera cut to girls screaming wildly in the crowd. Mick was clearly enjoying himself, and it apparent he had developed into a true star, working the crowd with his facial expressions and unique dance moves. Later that evening, with the lone accompaniment of Keith Richards on guitar, Mick serenaded the crowd with their hauntingly reflective composition, As Tears Go By. The last song of the evening brought all five band members back on stage for a scream filled version of their newest smash 19th Nervous Breakdown. Everyone, including The Rolling Stones, knew that The Ed Sullivan Show brought major exposure, so the group attempted to abide by Ed and CBSs rules in order to promote their new records. Though continuing to sell the image of rebellious bad boy rockers from London, the band clearly understood the importance of reaching the wide audience provided by the Sullivan show.",
            "By the end of the decade, the Rolling Stones were inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. In 1993, Bill Wyman announced his retirement. The Stones Voodoo Lounge album won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 1995 and prompted a world tour. Jagger and Richards agreed that their drifting in the 80s attributed to their success in the 90s. They believe that had they stayed together, they would have broken up. The Stones Keep On Rollin into the New Millennium The Rolling Stones have endured waxing and waning popularity over the decades. While band members are now in their sixties and seventies in the new millennium, they still perform, tour, and record. In 2003, Jagger was knighted to Sir Michael Jagger, causing another riff between himself and Richards, especially, according to Richards, because the bands message had always been antiestablishment. There was also a public outcry that questioned the appropriateness of knighting a former British tax exile. Documentaries regarding the bands exceptionally long and controversial career capture the counterculture movement, perfecting the technology of recording records, and flamboyantly performing to live audiences. The bands lips and tongue logo, designed by John Pasche in the 70s a symbol of their antiestablishment message, is one of the most identifiable band icons in the world.

These islands are dispersed across the western Pacific Ocean and contribute to the countrys total land area of approximately 300,000 square kilometres. The islands are organised into three primary geographical subdivisions Luzon to the north, Visayas in the centre, and Mindanao to the south. The islands vary in size and topography, ranging from expansive land masses like Luzon and Mindanao, which are replete with mountains, plains, and urban areas, to small, uninhabited islets that barely rise above sea level. Luzon is the largest island and serves as the political and economic heart of the nation. Here, youll find Metro Manila, the dense and sprawling capital, as well as important cities like Quezon City and Angeles. In contrast, the Visayas region is known for its smaller, more idyllic islands and a more laidback lifestyle. Cebu, Bohol, and Negros are some of the wellknown islands in this group, each with its distinct character, culture, and natural environments, including coral reefs and fertile farmlands. Mindanao, the secondlargest island, has its own unique character. This southern island is less visited by international tourists and offers a blend of indigenous cultures and natural landscapes, from highland plateaus to fertile valleys and a complex system of rivers and lakes. Mount Mayon, an active Volcano in Bicol, Philippines. Read more The Best Legazpi Tourist Spots, Philippines And a Few Things to Eat Too How do they count the total number of islands in the Philippines The count of the number of islands in the Philippines is based on official geographical surveys carried out by the governments mapping agency, the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority NAMRIA . These surveys often involve both aerial and marine reconnaissance, as well as satellite imagery, to get an accurate count. NAMRIA also relies on scientific methods that include measuring the elevation of land masses above sea level and determining their permanence, irrespective of tidal conditions, to qualify what constitutes an island. The official count can therefore change over time due to a variety of factors. Natural events such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and erosion can alter the landscape, leading to the emergence of new islands or the merging or disappearance of existing ones."

            "James Gosling Biography  Father of Java Programming Language  The Java Programmer Skip to content The Java Programmer Home Contact About Advertise Online Compiler Java Programs The Java Programmer Main Menu About Advertise Contact Java Programs Examples Online Java Compiler James Gosling Biography  Father of Java Programming Language Leave a Comment  Articles  By Neeraj Mishra James Gosling is the name that easily comes to ones mind when we think of pioneers of programming language. Born in Canada, in May 1955, James Arthur Gosling went on to become the founder and lead designer of Java Programming Language. Education  Early Life Gosling studied at William Aberhart High School in Calgary, Alberta, which was also his hometown. Having completed his Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the University of Calgary, James Gosling did his Masters and Ph.D. in the same major at Carnegie Mellon University. He did his doctoral thesis on The Algebraic Manipulation of Constraints. Even before he joined his first organization Sun Microsystems, James Gosling had built a multiprocessor version of Unix, and many compilers and mail systems, while he was at Carnegie Mellon University. How Was Java Created James Gosling chose Sun Microsystem after completing his Ph.D. for work in 1984. One day he came across a problem while trying to write a program to translate software code from one language to other, and like many inventions, this led to the creation of the Java programming language. The idea behind its creation was to create a programming language that one can write once and it will run wherever else you want. This was achieved with the assistance of talented Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton, of course. Earlier, James Gosling at Sun Microsystem worked on a project that helped the team with a windowing system, called SunDew, later renamed NeWS. This Networkextensible Windows System was designed to function with bitmapped displays on workstations, however, it was dropped over XWindows. What Was Java Called Originally James Gosling had named his programming language, Oak. However, over a copyright issue with the name Oak, he had to change it to Java. Java Was Too Advanced for Its Time Thats quite right, the programming language created by James Gosling was initially developed to serve digital interactive television. But, it proved to be a bit early for those days. His Goals to Achieve While Creating Java Gosling and Co. aimed to attain the following goals while creating Java Programming Language The language should be able to deliver high performance. The language should efficiently interpret, thread, and be dynamic in operation. The language should be secure and proficient. The language should be architectureneutralportable. The language should be simple, objective, and familiar. Rocketing to Success It didnt take time for computer scientist James Gosling Java to be a success story in the industry. It was widely used in web browsers, and Java applets were incorporated to perform more intriguing operations. Soon, APIs were developed for mobile, desktop, and enterprise applications. Not long, Java Virtual Machine was made free and open source software to the public, which led to further popularity and wider reach in the software industry. Quitting Sun Microsystems He left Sun Microsystems soon after Oracle acquired it in 2010. The reason for him leaving his metaphorical child behind was stated by the man himself later. James stated that he was not able to exercise autonomous decisions, which he found ethically challenging to work at Oracle. He also later said that the new owners wanted him to be a public face of Java, which he found humorous, and turned down by cheekily saying, he wasnt going to be MyersBriggs quadrant for that. Career Accelerated Even Post Java Many considered James Goslings move as the end of his remarkable career, but this wasnt to be. The creator of Java went on to work for Google on a highlevel job and then took a lead software position at a startup with the name Liquid Robotics, now acquired by Boeing. Presently, James Gosling is associated with Amazon Web Services as a Distinguished Engineer. Achievements and Recognition Popularly known as the Father of Java, James Gosling was honored as an Officer of Canada, which is the second highest civilian honor in Canada. James Gosling was recognized as an ACM fellow and was also awarded IEEE John von Neumann Medal for his impeccable achievements in Computer Science. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Engineering. James Gosling had also written for the bundle program, which was detailed in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pikes book, The Unix Programming Environment. James was honored with several prestigious awards, namely The Economist Innovation Award, and The Flame Award USENIX Lifetime Achievement Award. James Gosling not only changed the programming world for the better, but he has also shaped and reshaped our world of technology with his contribution.",

            "Can Emma Stone Sing No Result View All Result No Result View All Result Home Emma Stone Can Emma Stone Sing by Lisa Carter 20220510 Emma Stone has proven to be one of those Hollywood Alisters who truly fit the label. Since getting started around the early 00s, Emma has consistently shown audiences what she can do as a performerand boy, she can do a lot and she does them well. Now fans wonder, is singing included in her list of talents While Emma Stone is no professional singer or recording artist, the actress can definitely sing. She showcased her vocal prowess in La La Land , the movie that brought in her first Oscar award. Emma Stone  Tinseltown  Shutterstock.com The Oscars may not be the Tonys, but winning the Best Actress trophy for her role in La La Land is plausible proof that Emma Stone is also talented in singing. Lets explore the multiawarded actress background in that area of the performing arts. Did Emma Stone get singing lessons Emma Stone had always wanted to be a great entertainer before she even learned how to properly talk. At an early age, her parents signed her up in Valley Youth Theatre in her hometown, Arizona, where she had her first acting experience. She played Otter in the groups production of The Wind in the Willows . Broadway Thanks to her training in theatre, Emma had the right foundation to help her make a big leapinto Broadway, no less. From November 2014 to February 2015, Emma Stone took over Michelle Williams to portray Sally Bowles in Cabaret. What Is Emma Stone Doing Now Where Does Emma Stone Live Is Emma Stone Nice While her singing was criticized in a Variety review, it caught the attention of Damien Chazelle, who was impressed by her performance. So impressed was the Whiplash director that he cast her as the female lead in his thenupcoming project, La La Land. Singing on Easy A But before we move to her Oscarwinning performance, lets dial back a bit and talk about Easy A and the bit of singing she did in that movie. Remember this adorable scene Easy A came out in 2010, when Emma was still an upandcoming young star in Hollywood. While this performance is meant to be quirky and silly, Emma was able to show audiences that she can carry a tune while making us laugh. In case you were wonderingthe song she sang in this movie is Pocketful of Sunshine, originally by Natasha Bedingfield. Back to La La Land Despite having accomplished a run in Broadway playing the iconic character Sally Bowles, Emma still felt nervous about singing and dancing on the set of La La Land . But her experience in Cabaret set the stage excuse the pun for herafter all, she was singing live onstage eight times a week during the run. It was the perfect preparation for the film that would elevate her career to new heights, and we could not agree more. Did Emma Stone sing by herself in La La land Emma Stone spent three months training for her role in the romantic comedy movie. The actress and colead, Ryan Gosling , devoted their time to learning new skills for the film. Bravo to themtheir outstanding performance got them each acting nominations at the 2017 Academy Awards. Emma Stone was, in fact, the voice behind all her characters original score. It shows us that when an actress means business, she goes after it and doesnt stop until she nails the performance. Did Emma Stone dance by herself in La La Land The singing in La La Land was all her, but not the stunts. Emma had a stunt double, Emilie Livingstone, who did some of the dancing in the film. Those who had seen the film would probably understand. Many dance steps in the movie are quite advanced, something only dancers who have had extensive training can execute properly. You would see the stunt double in scenes where the characters were silhouettes. Some people criticized the director and the actors for using body doubles for the dancing in the film. How many songs has Emma Stone released Its amazing when people understand that they dont have to take advantage of every opportunity that comes their way. Even though Emma Stone had shown off her vocal chops in the musicals such as Cabaret and La La Land, she hadnt released any songs as a professional singer, nor does she have any plans in being one in the future. Upcoming projects We took a peek at Emmas IMDb page to find out what the actress is up to these days. And were glad to see she is one busy lady. She stars in Poor Things , a period piece set in Victorian times, with Willem Defoe. A TV show is in the works as well, titled The Curse , to premiere on Showtime.

We just sat there, staring at that piece of paper they give you, and I kept thinking there was a mistake. But there was no mistake in June of 2017, one month premature, Amal gave birth to twins Ella and Alexander . Getty Images They balance parenting with their demanding jobs. Returning to her work representing refugees in September of 2017, Amal has managed to excel at the office and as a mom. She is sort of this remarkable human being and now mother which is something, I suppose, you should assume she would be wonderful at as well. But, when you see it in person, it makes you feel incredibly proud and also incredibly small, George told Letterman. Coupled with Georges creative work and the 2017 sale of his Casamigos tequila brand , the duo remain very busy, but make the time to dedicate to their children, traveling with them to some of the familys favorite spots around the globe.

The dam is 60 metres 200 ft high and 4.5 kilometres 2.8 mi long and is the largest dam in Syria. 1 Its construction led to the creation of Lake Assad , Syrias largest water reservoir. The dam was constructed between 1968 and 1973 with help from the Soviet Union .

At 567 metres 1,860 ft high, it is the tallest dam in the world, either natural or manmade. The dam was created on February 18, 1911, when the 7.4 M s Sarez earthquake caused a massive landslide that blocked the flow of the river. 1 The dam is formed of approximately 2 cubic kilometres 0.48 cu mi of rock dislodged from the steeply sloped river valley of the Murghab , which cuts from east to west through the high and rough Pamir Mountains . It is named after the village of Usoi, which was completely buried by the 1911 landslide. The dam rises to a height of 500 to 700 metres 1,600 to 2,300 ft from the original valley floor. 2 The basin formed by Usoi Dam now holds Sarez Lake , a 55.8kilometre 34.7 milong lake holding 16.074 cubic kilometres 13,031,000 acreft  of water. Water does not flow over the top of the dam, which would quickly cause it to erode away instead, water seeps out of the base of the dam at a rate which approximately matches the rate of inflow, maintaining the lake at a relatively constant level. The level thus only rises an average of 20 cm per year. The flow averages about 45 cubic meters per second, with an annual variation of 3580 cubic meters per second 3 and dissipates about 250 megawatts. Geologists are concerned that the Usoi Dam may become unstable during future largemagnitude earthquakes, which are relatively common in the seismically active Pamirs, and might collapse due to liquefaction or subsequent landslides during such an event. 4 Collapse of the dam would unleash a locally catastrophic flood. 5 The Murghabs river valley tends to be relatively narrow and steep. This would focus and maintain any floods destructive power as it swept through the valley of the Murghob District . The dam wall survived a localised 7.2 magnitude earthquake, the 2015 Tajikistan earthquake , on the 7th December 2015 with no visible signs of deterioration.

But his successor, Tim Cook, is still largely an unknown. By Kit Eaton long Read Weve learned a lot about former Apple CEO Steve Jobss personality over the years. But his sucessor, Tim Cook, is still largely an unknown. Both men did deliver commencement speeches, which we compared in word clouds , but only Jobss address was available in text. Heres the complete transcript of then Apple COO Tim Cook s Auburn commencement speech. May 14, 2010. Auburn University. Its a tremendous honor and a privilege for me to be here with all of you. To be back to a place that really feels like home to me, and to be back to a place that brings back so many fond memories. Auburn has played a key role in my life and continues to mean a lot to me, as anyone who comes in my office at Apple or my home in Palo Alto instantly discovers. I have so much Auburn memorabilia you might think it was a California outpost for JM or Anders. As thrilled as I am to be here I stand before you knowing that the lives of many people here and even more across our state and beyond are deeply affected by the tragedy off our shores. I grew up on the Gulf Coast and my family still lives there and I want you to know that my thoughts and hopes are with you. Also as thrilled as I am to be here, I stand before you with a deep sense of humility both because of how I got here and who is here. I am where I am in life because my parents sacrificed more than they should have. Because of teachers, professors, friends, and mentors who cared more than they had to. And because of Steve Jobs and Apple who have provided me the opportunity to engage in truly meaningful work every day for over 12 years. And I know that Im offering words of advice in front of a faculty whose ideas and research positively impact our lives. And I do so in a gathering where the faculty is complemented by the hardwon wisdom of so many parents, grandparents, and even greatgrandparents that have been a source of incredible inspiration for todays graduates. So bearing all that in mind Ill share some personal discoveries with you that have at least served me well. Discoveries based on this most improbable of journeys that I have been on. My most significant discovery so far in my life was the result of one single decision My decision to join Apple. Working at Apple was never in any plan that Id outlined for myself, but was without a doubt the best decision that I ever made. There have been other important decisions in my life, like my decision to come to Auburn. When I was in high school some teachers advised me to attend Auburn, other teachers advised me to attend the university of Alabama and, well, like I said some decisions are pretty obvious. The decision to come to Apple which I made in early 1998 was not so obvious. Since most of you graduates were 10 years old at the time you may not realize that the Apple in early 1998 was very different than the Apple of today. In 1998 there was no iPad or iMac or iPhone, there wasnt even an iPodI know its hard to imagine life without iPods. While Apple did make Macs, the company had been losing sales for years and was commonly considered to be on the verge of extinction. Only a few months before Id accepted the job at Apple, Michael Dell, the founder and CEO of Dell Computer, was publicly asked what he would do to fix Apple, and he responded Id shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders. In making this statement what distinguished Michael Dell was only that he had the courage to say what so many others believed.",
            "Prior to his death, Steve Jobs included Cook in his succession plan. Jobs began grooming Tim Cook to be his predecessor in the early 2000s after being diagnosed with cancer. Between 2003 and his death in 2011, Jobs spent many hours mentoring Cook. They were close confidants. In addition, Cook also spent two periods as interim CEO in 2004 and 2009 where he oversaw the launch of iPad 2 and iCloud. How Is Tim Cook Different From Steve Jobs Compared to the largerthanlife Steve Jobs, known for his vision and charisma, Tim Cook is known for driving efficiency and performance. While Cook has not produced as many breakthrough products, he has overseen massive company growth, the launch of an Oscarnominated studio, and supply chain precision. In terms of management style, Jobs was a visionary leader, known for micromanaging and having an erratic temper. Cook, on the other hand, is known for his pragmatism and mastery of logistics. According to an interview in The Wall Street Journal , Cook is known for his cautious, collaborative, and tactical leadership style. The Bottom Line After a decade as CEO of Apple, Tim Cook is arguably one of the most consequential business leaders today. Overseeing a multitrillion dollar company with over a billion iPhone users globally, Apple is one of the most ubiquitous and profitable consumer brands.

            "What is the difference between forbearance and deferment What is the difference between forbearance and deferment A loan deferment is a temporary postponement of monthly loan payments. For subsidized loans, accrued interest will automatically be paid by the Department of Education if the loan is deferred. Forbearance is a temporary postponement of principal loan payments. Interest continues to accrue, but when you complete your term of service, the National Service Trust will pay the accrued interest on your behalf if you received an Education Award.

Deferment  Whats The Difference  Dictionary.com Previous May Be vs. Maybe Learn When Each One Might Be Used Next Alpha, Beta, Whats Next The Greek Alphabet Explained Forbearance vs. Deferment Whats The Difference August 24, 2021 Quick Summary What Is Forbearance What Is Deferment Forbearance Vs. Deferment If you have a loan, especially a student loan or a mortgage , there may come a time when you arent able to keep up with your payments. But there are options when it comes to repayment relief, including one called a forbearance and one called a deferment . Both can involve temporarily postponing or pausing or temporarily lowering loan payments. But there can be a crucial difference between the two, and its whether the interest on the loan stops accruing accumulating or continues accruing while regular payments are on pause. Thats a big difference, and it can add up to a lot of money. Luckily, were here to loan you our expertiseinterestfreeand provide an easytounderstand breakdown of exactly what both options mean, including specific examples of how each works in terms of mortgages and student loans.  Quick summary The word forbearance commonly refers to a temporary pause on loan payments that usually involves the loan balance continuing to accrue interest. A deferment , on the other hand, typically involves a temporary pause on loan payments without interest continuing to accrue. However, different financial institutions may use these terms differently, especially in the different contexts of mortgages and student loans. Always read the fine print. What is forbearance  Forbearance is a form of repayment relief granted by a lender that temporarily postpones payments due from a borrower, while interest on the loan typically continues to accrue. Lets break that down. The lender is the one providing the loanthe bank or institution loaning the money. The borrower is the one receiving the loanthe one responsible for paying it back. When a borrower is not able to keep up with their regular payments, the lender may offer the option of a forbearance , meaning that the borrower can pause payments for a temporary period of time. But the terms of a forbearance usually require interest to keep accruing on the balance thats owed. This means that a forbearance can result in an increase in the final amount required to be paid. Lets look at a simplified example involving student loans. Say you have 10,000 in student loans, and youre paying a 1 interest rate per month. At the end of the first month of forbearance , the total loan amount you need to pay back will actually be 10,100, because the interest has continued to build up. And it will be even more with each subsequent month, as the interest rate is applied to the balance in accordance with the specific terms of the loan. Learn the basic language of loans with this review on using loan , loaned , lend , and lent . Or, say that you have a 250,000 mortgage. Lets keep it simple and set the interest at a monthly rate of 1. Your lender may allow you to temporarily stop payments on your mortgage, such as after the loss of a job. At the end of the first month of a forbearance , your new balance will be 252,500, due to the accrued interest. The terms of a forbearance vary for different types of loans and different lenders. Outside of finance, forbearance has other, more general meanings related to selfcontrol and refraining from doing things. What is deferment  In the context of loans, deferment often refers to a pause on payments during which interest does not continue to accrue. In other words, a deferment allows you to temporarily stop making payments on your debt without the interest continuing to pile up. The word deferral is sometimes used in the same way. Taking this option is sometimes called deferring a loan. In the student loan and mortgage examples above, if you were granted a deferment of your loan payments, you would still owe the same amount 10,000 or 250,000 whenever you were able to resume payments. Your loan would neither grow nor shrinkit would be temporarily frozen. Sometimes, lenders use the word deferment in other ways. For example, its sometimes used to refer to an option that follows a forbearance , in which the skipped payments are set aside to be paid after the rest of the loan has been paid. Like forbearance , the word deferment has other, more general meanings outside of finance, but it usually involves the postponement of something. Our finances depend heavily on another set of terms worth discussing inflation vs. deflation."

In fact, Newsweek explained his infamous outbursts as coming from a young man who raised perfectly placed strokes to a high art form, only to resort to tantrums that smear his masterpieces like graffiti. Still, theres no denying McEnroes surliness toward opponents and referees was only matched by the Grand Slam winners uncontested prowess on the tennis court. John McEnroes tennis career A natural athlete in high school, McEnroe made a name for himself in the tennis world after graduation. He won the first of his 17 total Grand Slams at the French Open in 1977. Enjoying his first notable success with mixed doubles partner Mary Carillo, McEnroe intended to compete for the junior title at Wimbledon next. However, his expertise won him a spot in the mens competition where he finished as a semifinalist against Jimmy Connors. At 18, McEnroe was the youngest man to reach such heights at Wimbledon, and it formed the foundation for his future success. He won a scholarship to Stanford and led the tennis team to an NCAA Championship before turning pro at the end of his freshman year. The rookie led Tony Traberts U.S. team to its first Davis Cup victory in six years. It became the first of five American Davis Cup world titles 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, and 1992. The crowddrawing rivalry between Bjorn Borg and McEnroe began during the mens singles finals at Wimbledon in 1980 . While Borg was victorious, it remains one of the finest Wimbledon games ever played. Known as the  Fire and Ice  rivalry, Borg and McEnroe competed against each other 22 times. Each won 11 matches. McEnroes 1981 Wimbledon victory will forever be remembered by what became his catchphrase. While demeaning an official over a call made in his opponents favor, McEnroe screams, You CANNOT be serious It was an event for which he was penalized. McEnroes fever pitch continued on the cour. At the 1984 Stockholm Open, he was suspended for three weeks for calling the umpire a jerk. The athlete completed his turn at the French Open the same year with a loss to Ivan Lendl. It marked the beginning of McEnroes downhill slope. Ranked the No. 1 mens tennis player from 1981 through 1984, McEnroe slowly began to unravel. By 1985, his skirmishes on and off the court cost him valuable opportunities. He struggled to keep pace with younger competitors. Elsewhere, McEnroes volatile behavior disqualified him from the Australian Open and U.S. Davis Cup. With family taking center stage, McEnroe took a sabbatical in 1986. His return, however, continued to be plagued by misbehavior. In 1990, McEnroe was disqualified from the Australian Open for unsportsmanlike conduct. He continued to impress as a Davis Cup player, but by 1992, McEnroe sought a change. McEnroe embarked on a new career as a TV sports analyst covering the 1992 French Open. In 1999, the tennis star was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. John McEnroes Grand Slam wins With a total of 17 Grand Slam wins, McEnroes illustrious record involves victories in the singles and doubles categories. Singles McEnroe won a total of seven Grand Slam singles  Wimbledon in 1981, 1983, and 1984 as well as the US Open in 1979, 1980, 1981, and 1984. Doubles One mixeddouble and nine doubles tournaments were won by McEnroe . His first Grand Slam win was the mixed doubles match at the 1977 French Open."

It is exactly situated at the Wawa Gorge along the Sierra Madre mountain range between the two prominent mountains Mt. Pamitinan and Mt. Binacayan. Wawa Dam has a height of 13 meters or 43 feet. It has a length of 85 meters and it is surrounded by rock walls and marble boulders. Moreover, it comes out like a gateway to the sky and it is just a onehour drive from Metro Manila. According to its past history, Wawa Dam was constructed on top of the Marikina River to supply water to Metro Manila during the American colonial period in the Philippines in the year 1904. It was completely finished and began operating in the year 1909. Wawa Dam originated from the Dumagat word wawa which means entrance. As the years passed by, it is the only key source of water around Metro Manila. However, in 1968, Wawa Dam was deserted due to Angat Dam which was completely polished to supply water around Metro Manila. Angat Dam is a hydroelectric dam and watershed system that is becoming the main source of water in Metro Manila and nearby provinces during the 1970s. In 2019, Wawa Dam was still recognized as an important cultural property of the National Museum. Fast forward to 2021, Wawa Bulk Water Supply Project has been ongoing, and once finished it will send adequate water supply to nearly 500,000 households in Metro Manila and Rizal part. In September 2022, the House Committee on Tourism and lawmakers declared Wawa Dam a tourist site. For this reason, it will help the local residents near the dam to have more opportunities and more income to add to their daily lives. Presently, Wawa Dam is part of the Pamitinan Protected Landscape PPL and its always being controlled and monitored by the local officials. According to the local government unit of Rodriguez, almost 2000 tourists come to Wawa Dam every week to refresh and swim. So if you want to relax and take a break from the busy city life then visit Wawa Dam as soon as possible. Wawa Dam Name Wawa Dam Location Barangay San Rafael, Rodriguez, Rizal, Philippines Features relaxing place and budgetfriendly tourist destination My trip to Wawa Dam In the past few days, I was invited by Kevin one of my colleagues to visit Wawa Dam in Rizal province this coming holidays. But before I accepted the invite, I check my schedule if Im permitted to travel that day and I research a lot about Wawa Dam since I dont know the exact location and surroundings. Thankfully, it was Wednesday evening when I decided to accept the invite because Im available on a holiday trip and Im excited to go to places Ive never been before. It was Monday morning when I and Kevin started commuting going to Wawa Dam. The ride is smooth since it was a holiday and there are only a few cars on the road. We arrived at the registration area of Wawa Dam around 8 am in the morning and we paid the minimal entrance fee. After that, we walk towards the dam for eighteen minutes and we pass a wide footpath where we can see local residents selling their own fruit and vegetable. A few moments while slowly walking I noticed the two big mountains that surround us so I asked Kevin what is the name of that mountain. He immediately replied to me that the two huge mountains I saw is the twin mountains known as Mt. Binacayan and Mt. Pamitinan. Then after several meters of walking uphill, we found ourselves trekking on the side of one of the mountains. I slowly feel the grasp of nature and it cultivates my soul and spirit. Honestly, I feel like Im in a remote paradise setting with peace of mind and so much freedom. A few minutes later, the continuous moderate ascending trail reward us with the spectacular scenery of the two adjacent mountains and the river below. We stop for a moment to take a snapshot of the remarkable view. A few seconds later we resumed our walking and we passed a short tunnel on the side of the mountain. As a result, I recall the glimpse history of this dam while walking along the trails. short tunnel going to Wawa Dam After that, we passed an installed safe walkway with iron rails but at this time, we can see vandalism and garbage along the way.",

Legend has it that a mythological giant hero named Bernardo Carpio held the two mountains apart with his mighty hands to keep them from clashing. Some versions claim that he was trapped in between and is still trying to break his chains to this day. It was also historically used by the revolutionary leader Supremo Andres Bonifacio , who established the Katipunans secret headquarters in one of Pamitinans caves. It is where they declared independence from Spain, a year before the Philippine Revolution began. Until now, the cave still bears the Katipunans scribbled words  Viva la Independencia . The dam started operating during the American occupation in 1909 to supply the water demands of Manila, but it was eventually abandoned when the Angat watershed system got completed in 1962. Nevertheless, Wawa was still acknowledged as an Important Cultural Property by the National Museum in 2019.

Treasury yields are an important indicator of investor confidence in the U.S. economy.

Longterm bond yields are also indicators of investor confidence in the U.S. economy, and when Treasury bonds have low yields, people tend to look to stocks and other investments for better returns. Related Sign up for stock news with our Invested newsletter. How Do Treasury Yields Work The driving principle behind treasury yields is demand. In other words, the higher the demand for treasury bonds, the lower the yield and vice versa. Yields drop when demand is high and rise when demand is low. Thats because bonds can be sold on the secondary market, where investors can purchase previously issued financial instruments like bonds. If prices on the secondary market differ from the primary market, yields automatically adjust accordingly. For example, if you purchase a bond on the secondary market at a lower price than it originally sold for, its yield would rise because the Treasury still has to issue a payment equal to what the original yield would have produced. The 10year yield is a good example of why people pay attention to bond yields. This is a crucial economic benchmark because it affects other interest rates. Mortgage rates and other borrowing costs also tend to increase when the yield on the 10year note goes up. Investors typically want to earn as much as possible on their investments, and Treasury bonds are relatively safe investments that dont tend to pay out as much as other investments, such as stocks or real estate. The Treasury sells bonds at auction, and prices and yields change along with demand. If Treasury yields are high, it means that bond prices are low and investor demand is low due to higher confidence in other investments. The reverse also holds true. Yield Curve A yield curve refers to a line graph that shows how yields of bonds with the same initial value change according to their maturity dates.

Open An Account Commonly cited maturity dates include one month three months one year two years three years five years seven years 10 years 20 years 30 years Economists compare a common set of yield curves as an indicator of the strength of the economy. If longerterm yields are higher than shorterterm yields, investors tend to have a positive longterm economic outlook. On the other hand, if the longerterm yields are lower than shortterm yields, that indicates a lack of confidence in the longterm strength of the economy. There are three types of yield curves Normal yield curves slope upward, showing how longterm bonds typically have higher yields to compensate investors for the increased risk of holding bonds over longer periods. This reading indicates that the market anticipates higher interest rates, increasing economic growth and higher inflation. Flat yield curves demonstrate that regardless of the maturity dates of different bonds, their yields are about the same. A flattening curve indicates a transitional period of uncertainty about where the economy is headed. It could mean that there are expectations of decreasing inflation or an impending federal funds rate increase. Inverted yield curves slope downward, which means that shortterm bonds have higher yields than longterm bonds. Inverted yield curves often signal an upcoming period of economic decline. Read The Ultimate Guide to Bonds. What Do Treasury Yields Mean for Investors Treasury yields are a useful indicator of the markets economic outlook. If Treasury yields show that a period of economic growth is likely, investors may want to rebalance their portfolios to include more aggressive, riskier investments to take advantage of shifting macroeconomic conditions. FAQs What does a yield curve inversion mean Between 1955 and 2018, the yield curve inverted before each recession  making it a good warning sign that a period of economic decline is likely. An inversion does not always guarantee a recession, however. Are Treasury yields and Treasury bonds the same thing No. A Treasury yield is the effective annual interest rate paid by the U.S. government to a bondholder. A Treasury bond is a loan that you make to the government. What does a high Treasury yield mean Higher longterm yields mean that demand for Treasury bonds is decreasing, which indicates that investors are looking elsewhere for better returns.

Starting out as a saloon singer in musty little dives he carried his own P.A. system, he eventually got work as a band singer, first with The Hoboken Four, then with Harry James and then Tommy Dorsey . With the help of George Evans Sinatras genius press agent, his image was shaped into that of a street thug and punk who was saved by his first wife, Nancy Barbato Sinatra . In 1942 he started his solo career, instantly finding fame as the king of the bobbysoxersthe young women and girls who were his fansand becoming the most popular singer of the era among teenage music fans. About that time his film career was also starting in earnest, and after appearances in a few small films, he struck boxoffice gold with a lead role in Anchors Aweigh 1945 with Gene Kelly , a Best Picture nominee at the 1946 Academy Awards. Sinatra was awarded a special Oscar for his part in a short film that spoke out against intolerance, The House I Live In 1945 . His career on a high, Sinatra went from strength to strength on record, stage and screen, peaking in 1949, once again with Gene Kelly, in the MGM musical On the Town 1949 and Take Me Out to the Ball Game 1949 . A controversial public affair with screen siren Ava Gardner broke up his marriage to Nancy Barbato Sinatra and did his career little good, and his record sales dwindled. He continued to act, although in lesser films such as Meet Danny Wilson 1952 , and a vocal cord hemorrhage all but ended his career. He fought back, though, finally securing a role he desperately wantedMaggio in From Here to Eternity 1953 . He won an Oscar for best supporting actor and followed this with a scintillating performance as a coldblooded assassin hired to kill the US President in Suddenly 1954 . Arguably a careerbest performancegarnering him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actorwas his role as a pathetic heroin addict in the powerful drama The Man with the Golden Arm 1955 . Known as OneTake Charlie for his approach to acting that strove for spontaneity and energy, rather than perfection, Sinatra was an instinctive actor who was best at playing parts that mirrored his own personality. He continued to give strong and memorable performances in such films as Guys and Dolls 1955 , The Joker Is Wild 1957 and Some Came Running 1958 . In the late 1950s and 1960s Sinatra became somewhat prolific as a producer, turning out such films as A Hole in the Head 1959 , Sergeants 3 1962 and the very successful Robin and the 7 Hoods 1964 . Lighter roles alongside Rat Pack buddies Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. were lucrative, especially the famed Oceans Eleven 1960 .",

Sinatras daughter Nancy on the importance of Dolly in Sinatras life and character. 16 When Sinatras mother, Natalina, was a child, her pretty face earned her the nickname Dolly. As an adult, she stood less than 5 feet 1.5 m tall and weighed approximately 90 pounds 41 kg. Sinatra biographer James Kaplan describes her as having a politicians temperamentrestless, energetic, unreflective. 17 She was the daughter of a lithographer . 18 Born in Genoa in northern Italy, she was brought to the United States when she was two months old. 19 Dolly was influential in Hoboken and in local Democratic Party circles. 20 She used her knowledge of Italian dialects and fluent English to translate for immigrants during court proceedings, particularly those pertaining to requests for citizenship. This earned her the respect of local politicians, who made her a Democratic ward leader. 8 She was the first immigrant woman to hold that position in her local third ward, and reliably delivered as many as six hundred votes for Democratic candidates. 21 In 1919, she chained herself to city hall in support of the Womens suffrage movement. She also worked as a midwife , earning 50 for each delivery, a fair amount of money at the time. These activities kept Dolly away from home during much of her sons childhood. 17 b Sinatra biographer Kitty Kelley claims that Dolly also ran an illegal abortion service that catered to Italian Catholic girls, and was so well known for this doctors referred their patients to her, including in neighboring Jersey City and Union City . 23 c Immigrants arriving at Ellis Island, c. 1902 Sinatras father, Antonino  a small, blueeyed, ruddycomplexioned man 19  was from Lercara Friddi , near Palermo , Sicily . 5 His parents had originally been vineyard cultivators."

            "If you want to buy the stock and receive the dividend, you need to buy it on Monday. When the stock is trading with the dividend, the term cum dividend is used. If you want to sell the stock and still receive the dividend, you need to sell on or after Tuesday the 6th. Different rules apply if the dividend is 25, or greater, of the value of the security. In this case, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA indicates that the exdate is the first business day following the payable date. Special Considerations on Dividends The only other date that is worth mentioning is the date of payment. That is the date the company delivers dividends to the shareholders of record. This can be a week or more after the date of record. It may sound like easy money. Just buy a stock two days before the date of record and grab the dividend. Its not that easy. Remember, the declaration date has passed and everybody else knows when the dividend is going to be paid too. On the exdividend date, the stock price will drop by roughly the amount of the dividend as traders acknowledge the reduction in the companys cash reserves.

            "MOVIES ON THE BIG SCREEN WHOS ON FIRST ANYBODY by Michael Schlesinger Whats new at the American Cinematheques Egyptian and Aero Theaters Thursday, August 13, 2015 WHOS ON FIRST ANYBODY by Michael Schlesinger A long, long time agoby which I dont mean around the time of GHOSTBUSTERS, but 70, 80, 90 years backshow biz had a hallowed tradition the comedy team. These werent just actors who frequently worked together, like Adam Sandler and Kevin James, or Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, but actual, official teams, usually two men, their names separated by an ampersand, generally a comic and a straight man though the latter could also be funny. Occasionally there were more than two, and even more occasionally, there was a woman notably Gracie Allen, but two men were the norm. We know them by their names Laurel  Hardy, Abbott  Costello, Martin  Lewis, Wheeler  Woolsey, Olsen  Johnson, Burns  Allen and more. As well as the bigger groups The Three Stooges, The Marx Brothers, The Ritz Brothers, and that huge aggregate variously known as The Dead End Kids, The Little Tough Guys, The East Side Kids, and The Bowery Boys. That last bunch requires a flow chart. But sadly, with a few exceptions conspicuously the Stooges, arguably more popular now than in their heyday, if they ever actually had a heyday, most people born after Woodstock would not know them on sight. One night, Jay Leno was doing Jaywalking and asking pedestrians to identify famous movie stars of the past. One identified Laurel  Hardy as The Three Stooges. Even after Leno pointed out that there were only two people in the photo, she still insisted they were The Three Stooges. I still cringe at the thought of this. So what happened Why did the comedy team die out Hard to say with any certainty, but one very real possibility is that America simply grew up, and so did its entertainment. More often than not, the comic part of the team was a manchild Laurel, Costello, Wheeler, Lewis, Curly Howard, and Huntz Hall all seemed like eightyearold boys in the bodies of 40yearold men. By the 1950s, they were getting older, and that juvenile shtick didnt seem so funny anymore. Moreover, television had become the new vaudeville, and more adult, romantic comedies were filling the big screen. The funny hats and baggy pants were being replaced by more sophisticated fare starring the likes of Rock Hudson, Jack Lemmon, Paul Newman, and James Garner, as well as older but still sexy men such as Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, and David Niven. Jerry Lewis continued to have a successful solo film career, but he was an anomaly, while Groucho moved to TV and assumed a new persona as a waggish quiz show host. The great comedies of the past found a new home on the tube, but as The Late Show or on weekend afternoons. A few newer teams kept fairly busy in night clubs and on variety shows, like Rowan  Martin, Wayne  Shuster, and Allen  Rossi, but the tradition had well and truly passed. No, I havent forgotten Cheech  Chong, but they had an entirely different appeal and an entirely different audience. Yet despite their obvious similarities, all the great teams were unique. Their looks, their voices, their body language were distinctive to each, and even when they performed identical material e.g. Slowly I Turn, they put their own spin on it. Laurel  Hardy were slow and methodical, allowing situations to incrementally increase past the point of no return sometimes just the merest glance was hysterical. Abbott  Costello didnt sing or dance, but performed elaborate duologues that kept audiences gasping, while the latter took tremendous falls at the drop of a derby. Olsen  Johnson didnt even pay attention to the plot just gags, gags and more gags. The Stooges used the plot as a starting point they just did anything that was funnythe rules be damnedand it worked. The Marx Brothers were a threering circus a fasttalking sharpy, a mime, and a scamp with an Italian accent as well as a straight man when Zeppo was there, allowing all sorts of permutations depending on who was paired with whom at any given moment. It can be frustrating when younger people wont watch this stuff because its in blackandwhite, or because the content is considered quaint by todays standards. But those of us who treasure comedy in all forms dont give up.",

He is perhaps best known for his work with the hardcore punk band Black Flag from 1981 to 1986, and for leading the Rollins Band since 1987. Critic Steve Huey decribes Rollins as a postpunk renaissance man  Rollins is relentlessly busy  and has kept his artistic integrity, becoming a kind of father figure for many alternative bands of the 90s. Rollins grew up in Washington, D.C.. His parents divorced when he was young, and Rollins was raised primarily by his mother, Iris, who taught him to read before he entered school, and who he credits with instilling his lifelong love of reading. He was prescribed Ritalin as a child and was sent to the The Bullis School, a Washington, D.C. military school. He disliked the authoritarian atmosphere and the thenboysonly campus, which impeded his early attempts at dating and made him uncomfortable around women for several years. More positively, he said Bullis helped instill in him a sense of discipline and a strong work ethic. It was at military school that he began to develop his muscular build, and began writing. Rollins described his early literary efforts as follows I would write short stories, and theyre probably horribly written, about blowing up my school and murdering all the teachers. Which I would show to this English teacher who I was friends with, my one ally at this school. And he would go, Okay, dont show this to your real English teacher. You know, because you cant say fuck and hand it in as an essay at this school. I went to a pretty uptight all boys school. But he said, Show me this stuff. And, I like that youre writing creatively. Keep this up. Just dont show it to your teacherteacher because youll get in trouble. After high school, Rollins worked at a number of jobs including as a laborer at the National Institutes of Health, before becoming the manager of a HäagenDazs ice cream store. A longtime music fan with wideranging tastes a fan of Washington D.C.s funky Go Go music from his teen years Rollins became involved in the punk music scene through his close friend Ian MacKaye who would later head Minor Threat and Fugazi . Bad Brains was one of Rollinss favorite groups singer H.R. would sometimes coax Rollins onstage to sing with them. Rollins joined S.O.A. State of Alertas a singer the group released one EP on Dischord Records before disbanding. Rollinss steady employment enabled him to finance the recording and pressing of the S.O.A. EP. In 1981, his friend Mitch Parker gave him a copy of Black Flags Nervous Breakdown EP. Rollins soon became a huge fan and began exchanging letters with the group. When Black Flag toured the East coast, playing Washington D.C. and New York City, Rollins attended as many performances as he could. At an impromptu show in a bar, he asked to sing Clocked In . As vocalist Dez Cadena was switching to guitar, the band invited Rollins to a rehearsal. Impressed by his stage demeanor, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist. Despite some doubts, he accepted, due in part to MacKayes encouragement. His high level of energy and intense personality made him a perfect fit as their frontman. After joining Black Flag, Garfield changed his surname, and got the Black Flag logo tattooed on his arm thought it was the back of his ultrathick neck."

Each time a new movie comes out, tickets are always sold out and theaters swarmed with hyped fans all over the world. Advertisement While MCU movies are toprated by fans, some critics and reviewers take their time to give ratings to movies based on certain criteria. Rotten Tomatoes has given ratings to every Marvel film and lets see which one hit the bottom, literally. Advertisement Thor  77 This is Thor s introduction in the MCU and Asgards first exhibit of its wonderful realms. Kenneth Branagh, the movies director, flawlessly displayed the mysticism of the Norse tale through its beautiful costumes and majestic visual effects. Advertisement While it was the most fitting presentation of the world of Asgard, the most important scenes took place on Earth. The film is still a top choice for Marvel fans, especially when rediscovering the God of Thunders origin.

However, Ultrons portrayal did not live up to the audiences expectations. He also wasnt able to fully establish himself as a villain. Regardless, it is still a crucial part of the entire MCU saga. It paved the way for two of the most important characters to appear in later films, Scarlet Witch, and Vision. Advertisement Iron Man 2  72 The sequel to the original Iron Man movie seemed to walk the same path and only introduced new characters and no new plot. A lot of characters development, especially the villains, did not come to fruition or the peak of their evilness. Advertisement Despite this shortcoming, the film did fairly well at the box office. This success could be attributed to the introduction of new characters namely Black Widow and War Machine. The Incredible Hulk  67 Advertisement Marvel was still testing the waters when they released The Incredible Hulk in 2008. The whole MCU setup was still a fresh concept and despite the film not hitting the mark, it was still included in the 2012s The Avengers . There was also a recasting for Bruce Banner and the Hulk is now portrayed by Mark Ruffalo. Thor The Dark World  66 Advertisement The sequel to the Thor movie franchise is, unfortunately, one of the most forgettable films in the MCU. Not to say that it was bland or uneventful but there seemed to be no major occasion that took place here. The Dark World , however, served as the major platform in presenting the Infinity Saga. Eternals  48 Advertisement Currently the lowest rated movie in the entire MCU library, Eternals received the first rotten rating. The film is considered a risky move. Other MCU movies which did not feature the Original Six such as Guardians of the Galaxy , Black Panther , and AntMan , successfully made it to the top. This low rating is attributed to the initial criticisms that the movie received even before it was released in theaters. Hopefully, these characters will find redemption in the next MCU films to come.

Iron Man 2 2010 Despite what its position at the very bottom of this list may imply, Iron Man 2 is not completely devoid of fun. For example, the suitcase armor is still a very cool concept, and Tony Stark activating it while staring down Mickey Rourkes Ivan Vanko is a great moment. Speaking of which, who could forget Rourkes weird pronunciation of the word bird All good stuff. Unfortunately, everything else is less good. The movie features the introduction of Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow, and while she would eventually go on to become a core pillar of this series, here shes practically just an object to be gawked at like that portable gear. Then theres the big final battle, with Tony fighting an army of faceless Iron Man clones and then taking out a newly armored Vanko in a matter of moments, neither of which are particularly cool or satisfying.

The Incredible Hulk 2008 The Incredible Hulk 2008 Official Trailer  Edward Norton, Liv Tyler Movie HD Even back in 2008, the thennascent MCUs new version of The Incredible Hulk was something of a hedge. It recast and rebooted the character just five years after Ang Lees divisive and memorable take on the character , yet left enough wiggle room for less attentive audience members to assume it was some form of sequel. When the role was recast again for The Avengers , this Universal release was further consigned to alsoran status, and with good reason. Though Ed Norton is wellcast as both softspoken Bruce Banner and his furious alter ego, and director Louis Leterrier knows his way around pulpy action, this watchable, forgettable movies braintobrawn ratio is all out of whack, perhaps in part due to Nortons squabbles with the filmmakers over the movies tone. At the time, this was considered part and parcel with the actors difficult reputation. Years later, though, Edgar Wright, Joss Whedon, and others had their own behindthescenes struggles with the Marvel machine to relate.

Ortega Getty  Albert L. Ortega George Clooney was one of Hollywoods most eligible bachelors for years. But that all changed when the Oscar winner met and fell hard for his nowwife, highprofile humanrights lawyer Amal Clooney née Alamuddin . Not only is George a married man, but hes also a dad to two kids. George and Amal got married in a ceremony in Venice, Italy, in 2014, and the latter gave birth to their fraternal twins , Alexander and Ella, in June 2017. Though George is known for starring in dozens of Hollywood productions, including Oceans Eleven, Up in the Air, Gravity, and  Ticket to Paradise , his roles as a husband and father are the ones closest to his heart. In marriage, and now with the kids, you give away the selfishness of only looking out for yourself, George told People in 2020. Its a wonderful thing. Amal and I talk about it every day. . . . We feel so lucky. Though George and Amal havent made any public appearances with their children, theyre not shy about talking about them in the press. In an Oct. 21, 2022, interview on The Drew Barrymore Show, George confessed that he was terrified when he found out he was having twins. That wasnt part of the plan, he said. We went to that thing at 12 weeks where they go, theres the kid. To look at the picture of the kid. And the doctor goes, Its a boy. Then he goes, And a girl. And I was like, What It was such a disaster. I was like, Are you kidding me Of course, George treasures his kids now. Now, its the greatest thing in the world, he added. I was terrified then. On Dec. 4, 2022, while walking the red carpet for the 45th Kennedy Center Honors, the Clooneys told  Entertainment Tonight  a bit about their twins talents and personalities. They have a language that they speak that we dont speak, Amal said Alexander and Ella speak French and Italian. Meanwhile, George joked about their mischievous senses of humor. They have some jokes that they play, theyre so filthy, Im not even allowed to tell you, George shared. Whose contribution do you think this is, in parenting Amal asked, to which George jokingly responded, My wife is filthy. Filthy Today, it seems George and Amal have formed a real partnership as parents. On Sept. 2, a source told Us Weekly , they are taking turns with taking the kids to activities and take turns preparing the kids breakfast and lunches during their summer in Italy. The insider also shared that the couples twins are loving their summer with their parents, adding that they take boat rides and have a small group of friends in the area their age they have playdates with. Previously, in a 2017 interview with The Hollywood Reporter , George reflected on fatherhood and opened up about whether he missed his bachelor lifestyle. I sure dont, he said. That seems like a lifetime ago. Now my house is filled with the warm sounds of babies crying. You should see when my friends show up and see me change a diaper, the laughter that comes from them. I go, I know, I know. Ive given them so much sht for so many years, I deserve every bit of it. Keep reading to learn more about George and Amals children.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences first recognized the technical contributions of special effects to movies at its inaugural dinner in 1928, presenting a plaque for Best Engineering Effects to the first Best Picture Oscar winner, the World War I flying drama Wings . Producer David O. Selznick , then production head at RKO Studios, petitioned the Academy Board of Governors to recognize the work of animator Willis OBrien for his groundbreaking work on 1933s King Kong 1933 . But it was not until 1938 when a film was actually recognized for its effects work, when a Special Achievement Award for Special Effects was given to the Paramount film Spawn of the North . The following year, Best Special Effects became a recognized category, although on occasion the Academy has chosen to honor a single film outright rather than nominate two or more films. From 1939 to 1963, it was an award for a films visual effects as well as audio effects, so usually it was given to two persons, although some years only one or the other type of effect was recognised. In 1964, it was given only for visual effects, and the following year the name of the category was changed to Best Special Visual Effects . Between 1972 and 1977, there was no specific award for visual effects. As such work was awarded within the umbrella award called Special Achievement Academy Award. In 1977, a specific award category for visual effects was reintroduced with the current name, Best Visual Effects, although until 1995, visual effects could for some years continue to be given within the Special Achievement Academy Award instead. Which 1990 was the last year there was no official nominations, but instead a special achievement given.

Today Im going to talk about another Famicom game Devil World. Developed and published by Nintendo, Devil World was released for the Famicom in 1984. It was conceived by Nintendos very own Shigeru Miyamoto, responsible for such legendary franchises as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and more. Devil World was never released in North America due to Nintendo of Americas strict policies regarding content. The company was notorious for censoring things like violence, nudity, religious symbolism, and more in order to keep their games familyfriendly. Devil World would be the only game designed by Shigeru Miyamoto to never see a North American release, even to this day, although it did get an NES release in Europe in 1987. Were gamers missing out on something big Lets take a look. The game boots up with a simple title screen and cute music, typical for Black Box NES games. The story is that a devil has invaded an unnamed world, and a dragon that inhabits the world named Tamagon sets off to stop him from taking over. Devil World is a maze game similar to PacMan. I wont talk about the graphics and music too much because the former is just what youd expect from an early NES game especially if youve played Super Mario Bros.. The music is almost nonexistent, with only a couple of short jingles and sound effects. In Devil World, you must walk around the map and collect pellets for points while shooting fire at several bizarre creatures along the way. But you cant just shoot fire willynilly you have to collect crosses that will allow you to do it. Crosses only last for a limited time before they disappear, which is why there are several ridden throughout the stage. Without them, Tamagon is completely defenseless. Its a onehit death game, so be careful Theres also food that Tamagon can collect for bonus points. Devil World sounds just like a slightly beefedup version of PacMan, but heres what makes it unique at the top of the screen, the Devil will dance in several different poses. Depending on which direction he is facing, his minions will move the screen in that direction. There are no boundaries outside the frame, so you will be pushed in the direction the frame is moving. This adds to the games challenge, as not only will it render parts of the maze offlimits, but it can severely restrict Tamagon to the point where he can be crushed between the edge of the frame and a wall in the maze. The frame changes direction every few seconds, which creates the challenge of collecting all the dots while trying to stay alive. At the end of the first stage, you will move onto a bonus stage where you have to collect four different bibles and place them in a huge red box with a skull on it. The bibles dont move along with the frame they stay where they are programmed, even in the boundaries outside the frame. At the end of the second level, there will be another bonus stage where Tamagon has to collect six bonus boxes under a time limit. If he does, he will be awarded massive points. Thats Devil World in a nutshell. The game repeats its pattern after the second bonus stage, so in the end, its all about how many points you can rack up. Now lets talk about the reason why Devil World never came to North America. As I said before, Nintendo of America was very strict when it came to censoring inappropriate language and imagery in their games. Notable examples of this include Bionic Commando on NES and Mortal Kombat on SNES. Devil World contains several biblical references, including the bible , t he cross, and of course the titular villain.",

It was one of the many simple games created for the console in its early years, and was the first game designed by the partnership of Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka that would go on to create Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda . The game was released in Japan in 1984 and brought to Europe in 1987. It was later rereleased on the Virtual Console in both regions for Wii in 2008, then on Nintendo 3DS in 2013. North America had not imported the game presumably due to its religious themes until October 2023, when the game was made available as part of the NES catalogue for the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, this time worldwide. Tamagon, a cute little firebreathing dragon, has a devil of a problem. He has been trapped in a box within the maze of the Devils world. The Devils assistants are shifting the box up, down, right, and left, threatening to squash Tamagon between the walls. Tamagons task is twofold eliminate the boaboa dots that are the source of the Devils evil power, and then use four bibles to seal away the Devils icon.

        "predicted_answer": "Since Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2016, the company's stock has not performed well. According to The New York Times, Musk valued Twitter at 20 billion in a recent email to employees, which is a significant decrease from the 44 billion he paid to buy the company. It is also worth noting that Twitter's stock has declined as advertisers fled the platform after Mr. Musk's takeover. However, it is important to note that Musk has been making efforts to improve the platform and increase user engagement, such as asking users whether they would like an edit button. Additionally, Musk has been buying Twitter shares, with the latest filing showing that he has spent 2.64 billion on Twitter shares so far this year. This suggests that he is committed to investing in the platform and improving its performance.",

Share full article 460 In an email to Twitter employees, Elon Musk warned that Twitter remained in a precarious financial position and, at one point, had been four months away from running out of money. Credit... Jim WilsonThe New York Times By Kate Conger and Ryan Mac March 26, 2023 SAN FRANCISCO  Elon Musk said Twitter is now worth about 20 billion, according to an email he sent the companys employees on Friday, a significant drop from the 44 billion that he paid to buy the social network in October. The email, which was viewed by The New York Times, was sent to employees to announce a new stock compensation program. In it, Mr. Musk warned workers that Twitter remained in a precarious financial position and, at one point, had been four months away from running out of money. He said  radical changes  at the company, including mass layoffs and cost cutting, were necessary to avoid bankruptcy and streamline operations. Twitter is being reshaped rapidly, Mr. Musk wrote, adding that the company could be thought of as an inverse startup. Twitters value has declined as Mr. Musk has dramatically overhauled the company. In October, Mr. Musk took Twitter private, which means it is no longer obligated to provide transparency about its finances. But the billionaire has indicated publicly that the company lost revenue as advertisers fled the platform after his takeover, and suggested that Twitter was in danger of bankruptcy. The 20 billion figure values Twitter slightly higher than Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, which has recently struggled with an advertising slump and predicted its revenue would fall . Snap, which has a market capitalization of about 18 billion, has about 375 million daily active users, compared with Twitters 237.8 million in the companys final public disclosure before it went private. Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment and an email to Twitters communications department was returned with a poop emoji. The companys new valuation was earlier reported by The Information . According to Mr. Musks email about the new stock compensation program, Twitter employees will receive stock in X Corporation , the holding company he used to buy the company. Those awards will be granted under the 20 billion valuation. Mr. Musk also said in the email that he believed Twitter could someday be worth 250 billion. Twitter will plan to allow employees to sell the stock every six months, Mr. Musk added, akin to the practice at SpaceX, his privately held rocket manufacturer. The sales of private stock would allow employees to have liquid stock, but without the stock price chaos and lawsuit burdens of a public company, Mr. Musk wrote. Kate Conger is a technology reporter in San Francisco, where she covers Twitter.

X In the wake of a testy interview with Elon Musk, the former television anchor Don Lemon said that his deal for a new talk show on X was called off just days before it was scheduled to air. The Musk Foundation After making billions in taxdeductible donations to his charity, Musk has failed recently to donate the minimum required to justify a tax break  and what he did give often supported his interests. OpenAI Musk, who helped found the A.I. startup in 2015, has filed a lawsuit accusing the company and its chief executive of breaching a contract by putting profits and commercial interests ahead of the public good. SpaceX Musk said that the private rocket company, which he founded in 2002, had switched where it was incorporated to Texas from Delaware , a move that could bolster the Lone Star States standing with business .

            "284 LGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign voiced concern at Twitters new ownership and argued that Twitter has the responsibility to stop its platform from turning into a dangerous media environment. 195 Legacy  edit  On the first anniversary of the acquisition, Musk valued the company at 19 billion, a 55 percent decrease from the buyouts 44 billion purchase price. 373 374 Fidelity , which contributed 300 million to the acquisition, depressed the value by 65 percent. 375 Statistics indicated a 30 percent decline in active users, 60 percent decline in advertising, 376 14 percent decline in website traffic, 377 and 38 percent decline in app downloads. 378 The company has refuted these metrics, reporting an increase in engagement. 377 A nonfiction book about the acquisition, Breaking Twitter Elon Musk and the Most Controversial Corporate Takeover in History , was announced by author Ben Mezrich in December 2022 and released in November 2023. 379 380 Many publications reflected on Twitters first year under Musks ownership. Journalists for The Washington Post , citing data from the University of Washington , wrote that the platform had become a cacophony of misinformation and confusing reports, remarking on Twitters stark shift toward conservatism. 381 Pranav Dixit of The Guardian lambasted the changes and reforms Musk had instituted in the past year, 382 while Miles Klee of Rolling Stone criticized Musks alleged pandering to  rightwing extremists and peddlers of misinformation. 383 The Verge s Jay Peters pointed to Musks radical changes and declining user numbers as evidence that the takeover was a disaster, 384 while Bloombergs Aisha Counts zeroed in on the increase in misinformation and hate speech. 385 Kate Conger of The New York Times and Alex Kirshner of Slate lamented that Musks acquisition had fundamentally changed the meaning of Twitter. 386 387 Annika Burgess of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation declared, Twitter as the world knew it is dead. 388 Musk has largely dismissed this negative commentary. 389 390 391 References  edit   DOnfro, Jillian Ranj, Brandt January 20, 2022.

Related 8 Modern Actors That Could Become the Next Great Action Movie Hero It is a shame that they all had somewhat sad moments at the end of their lives. These actresses were some of the first people to be internationally famous, and their extremely daring stunts and practical effects made them action heroes of their time. However, not only did they have somewhat shortlived careers, but they were almost completely forgotten by todays filmmakers, and apparently todays actors and actresses. Women as Action Heroes Today Constantin Film Verleih  Pathé Distribution Knowing about these women that made a difference in the genre, it is also important to remember some examples of more recent roles that are also important. Ripley Sigourney Weaver and Trinity CarrieAnne Moss changed the game for women in scifi movies . They were some of the most incredible characters in the iconic franchises Alien and Matrix . Then there are the ones that made history from the start, such as Wonder Woman. It is important not to forget the backlash Captain Marvel Brie Larson received because she was a woman, and at that point, there havent been any feature superhero films with women in the protagonist role. Even in horror, there are a lot of examples, such as Alice Milla Jovovich in the adaptation of the video game Resident Evil . Lara Croft Angelina Jolie is also an adaptation of an action character from a video game. The Bride Uma Thurman in Tarantinos Kill Bill movies also changed how these protagonists were perceived. There are some actresses, like Charlize Theron, who acted in various action movies  even if they were not part of franchises. Either way, these actresses are only a few examples of women in these types of movies  that for a very long time were considered only for the male audience or the male gaze. As the years progressed, there has been a big shift in not only female leads but femalecentric stories, where their realities and problems are the centers of the narrative, and they are not a sexualized side character for the male protagonist. Lawrences character, Katniss Everdeen, is an example of roles that fit this new wave. All this research is not to drag Lawrence in the mud, but to educate everyone on these amazing women that truly paved the way for modern actresses to be a part of not only the action genre but cinema as a whole. Lets take this as an opportunity to fully acknowledge these artists that were forgotten with time. Maybe this could be the theme of the next groundbreaking biopic they certainly have the stories and importance to be remembered forever.

        "ground_truth": "billie jean",
        "retrieved_chunk": [
            "Thank goodness thats over. Billie Jeans greatest importance is that it launched the Michael Jackson era, a period in which the entire population of the planet made a group decision to follow the career of one star and one star only. This was an era in which a fabulously gifted performer like Prince was forced into a distant secondfiddle role, because even though Prince could dance, he couldnt dance like Michael Jackson. Jacksons allencompassing appeal was something that had never happened before in the history of pop music Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and the Beatles were preposterously famous in their time, but their appeal was still basically limited to white people. Michael Jackson, during his Thriller LP era, had everybody talking about him. Cute and cuddly as front manchild for the Jackson Five, Jackson had been trying for several years to reintroduce himself to a public that was ill prepared to view him as anything other than a charming hasbeen. To shatter this perception, Jackson created the flashy, enigmatic, vaguely dangerous persona who appeared in Billie Jean, Beat It and Bad. At a time when most music videos were either primitive or stupid, Jackson made a video that was clever, original, visually opulent and mysterious. This was the first time that a song had been upstaged by the performance of a song, creating a peculiar situation where no one really had any interest in hearing the song unless they could simultaneously watch the song being performed. Other bands  ZZ Top, the Police, Cyndie Lauper, the Bangles  were putting out amusing, entertaining videos at the time, but no one was watching them because of Stings dancing. Michael Jacksons footwork was the central conversational theme of Planet Earth throughout the 1980s. Not until the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 did mankind move on to another topic. Billie Jean, which has nothing to do with the tennis legend Billie Jean King, was recorded on a specially designed set to capture the muted sound of the snare drum that Jackson insisted upon. It was produced by the legendary Quincy Jones, who wanted Jackson to change the name of the song and also to shorten the improbably lengthy 29second introduction, during which Jackson does not actually sing. More thought went into the production of this single than would go into the entire recording careers of Axl Rose, Coldplay, Shania Twain or Gwen Stefani. The song stayed at the top of the charts for more than two months and propelled the album Thriller to its iconic status as the biggestselling record of all time. Because no one buys albums anymore, and because highconcept music videos are a thing of the past, and because lowkey, hybrid songs like Billie Jean sound anachronistic in the coarse hiphop era, Michael Jacksons achievements now seem as remote and inexplicable as those of the pharaohs. But, if youre in the mythmaking line of trade, the pharaohs are good company to be in.

            "Later on, he said hed gotten a nose job so that he could breathe better and hit higher notes. Through the 80s and beyond, Jacksons face changed. So did his complexion. Jacksons vitiligo caused blotches on his skin, and he wore makeup to cover it up. In the late 80s, Michael Jackson was one of the most visible people in the world, and people definitely talked about how his features were changing. So maybe it was brave for Jackson to release Man In The Mirror, the song about taking a long look at yourself and making a change, as a single in 1988. Or maybe Jackson just didnt care. Maybe he just knew that the song was powerful enough to shut everyone up, at least for a little while. If thats what Jackson thought, he was right. Man In The Mirror overwhelmed any and all talk about Michael Jackson the public figure. It became a kind of selfimprovement folk song, a gospel standard. To this day, Man In The Mirror seems to stand apart from the increasingly troubling legend of Michael Jackson. I remember hearing Man In The Mirror on supermarket speakers the weekend before HBO aired Leaving Neverland , the documentary about some of the abuse allegations against Jackson, and wondering if Id ever hear the song on any kind of institutional playlist again. But even if the public at large had turned against Jackson  and honestly, we really havent  then Man In The Mirror would probably still stand apart from all of that. Its clearly a Michael Jackson song, and yet it doesnt feel like a part of the Michael Jackson myth. Its something else. Man In The Mirror is one of only two songs on the Bad album that Michael Jackson didnt write. The other one is the Stevie Wonder duet Just Good Friends. General consensus, as far as I can tell, is that Just Good Friends is the worst song on Bad , but I dont know, I think its pretty good. Instead, Man In The Mirror came from Siedah Garrett and her writing partner Glen Ballard. Garrett didnt have a lot of experience as a songwriter she was more of a backup singer and vocal arranger, and shed been Jacksons duet partner on the Bad single  I Just Cant Stop Loving You . Ballard was a songwriter and producer whod done a lot of work with Quincy Jones. Jackson had almost included the Ballardwritten song Nightline on Thriller , but he bumped it at the last minute, and the Pointer Sisters recorded the song in 1983 instead. Ballards work will appear in this column again. Siedah Garrett has told the Man In The Mirror story a lot of times, and she always seems enormously and understandably happy about Michael Jackson recording her song. Garrett knew that Quincy Jones was looking for more potential hits for Jackson, but she also knew that Jackson turned down almost everything Jones brought him. Shed had the Man In The Mirror title written in a book of lyric ideas for years, and she brought it out during a writing session at Ballards house while he played around with the keyboard. The song came together quickly one Friday night, and Garrett recorded a demo right away. She was so excited about it that she couldnt wait for Jones office to reopen on the following Monday, so she drove it right over to his house. Jones loved the song, and so did Jackson. The version of Man In The Mirror from Siedah Garretts demo is very close to the one that Jackson recorded. Its a gospel song, essentially, though it never mentions God. Instead, Man In The Mirror is all about confronting yourself, realizing that you can be a better person, and making it happen. Theres tension in the song, in the choppiness of some of the vocal phrasing, and theres also the relief of that gloriously overwhelmed chorus melody. Jackson seized on that sensibility and fleshed it out further, adding a gigantic key change to the end of the song and bringing in a team of allstar gospel singers, including the Winans Family and the André Crouch Choir, to sing backup on it. Garrett sang backup, too, and Ballard programmed the Linn drum machines. Jackson sings Man In The Mirror as someone whos not happy with his own moral shortcomings. He knows that hes been the victim of a selfish kind of love  that hes victimized himself  and he starts things off by singing that he intends to do better Gonna make a change for once in my life. The song takes full advantage of the soft, vulnerable quality of Jacksons voice. On that intro, singing over glassy cascade of expensive keyboard sounds, Jacksons voice is halting and gasping, as if hes forcing himself to get the words out. As the song builds, though, Jacksons voice gets stronger."

It was released by Elektra Records on June 25, 1996, in the United States. The single,  Twisted , made it to number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 , his biggest hit ever on that chart.  Nobody  peaked at number 3 on the same chart. Both songs are his final two of six hits to reach number one on the RB singles chart and gave Sweat two more Top 5 pop hits in eight years since his first single,  I Want Her . Critical reception  edit  Professional ratings Review scores Source Rating AllMusic 1 Robert Christgau 2 Entertainment Weekly C 3 Hartford Courant favorable 4 Los Angeles Times 5 Muzik 6 Vibe favorable 7 USA Today 8 AllMusic editor Leo Stanley found that Sweat turns in a typically stylish and sophisticated set of urban soul and new jack swing, all highlighted by his silky singing. Sweats main talent is for smooth ballads, and Keith Sweat is filled with excellent selections, including the seductive  Come with Me , which features guest vocals by Ronald Isley . The album does bog down a bit with uneven material, but its high points are as captivating as any of Sweats previous work. 1 In a lukewarm review, Los Angeles Times writer Connie Johnson wrote what sounded new in 1987 may not be groundbreaking today, but Sweat can still crank out a Jeep jam or a temperatureteasing boudoir ballad with the best of them. 5 Chart performance  edit  The album is the most successful of Sweats career. It went to the US Billboard 200 , debuting at number 5 it was the final of five consecutive albums from the artist to reach number one on the Top RB Albums chart. The album has occasionally reentered the Billboard 200, with the most recent occurrence being the week of February 19, 2011. 9 On July 7, 2004, Keith Sweat was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA, for shipments of four million copies in the United States. 10 In 1996, the singles Twisted and Nobody were both certified platinum by the RIAA, for shipments of one million copies in the US. 10 Track listing  edit  Keith Sweat track listing No. Title Writers Producers Length 1.

        "query": "does a rhino or a grizzly bear weigh more?",
        "predicted_answer": "The rhino usually weighs more than the grizzly bear, but the grizzly bear has the advantage in terms of speed and agility, which gives them an edge in endurance. Rhinos are also more aggressive when provoked or threatened, but they rely on their thick skin and long horns for defense, while bears rely more on their claws and teeth. When it comes to offensive capabilities, bears are better suited for close-range combat, while rhinos have the physical strength to push and shove with their horns, which can be deadly if they can unbalance or knock down their opponent.",
        "ground_truth": "rhinos weigh more, reaching up to 8,000 pounds. while grizzly bears weigh up to 900 pounds.",
        "retrieved_chunk": [
            "Meanwhile, rhinos are massive creatures that can weigh up to 7,000 pounds, stand 6 feet tall at the shoulder, and grow upwards of 11 to 15 feet. They are known for their thick skin that is akin to armor and the fact that some of them have large horns that can measure between 8 and 30 inches in length. Each of the five extant species of rhinos is a herbivore. These differences will have a substantial impact on the fight, but we need more information to determine the winner. What Are the Key Factors in a Fight Between a Grizzly Bear and a Rhino Every fight in the wild comes down to a handful of different factors. This battle is no different. So, we are going to consider elements like offensive powers, size, and speed. Yet, we also want a wellrounded view of this fight, so weâre going to talk about predatory behaviors and defenses as well. By the time weâre done, weâll have a great idea of how these animals measure up and know who should win. Grizzly Bear vs. Rhino Size The rhinoceros weighs more than the grizzly bear. iStock.comEcoPic Rhinos are much larger than grizzly bears, even though the latter are big in their own right. The average rhino weighs between 1,700 and 7,700 pounds, stands 4.3 to 6 feet tall at the shoulder, and grows from 11 to 15 feet in length. This depends greatly on the species, though. The white rhinoceros is usually considered the largest species. Meanwhile, grizzly bears can weigh between 400 and 700 pounds most of the time, but they can get as heavy as 1,200 pounds. They stand between 3 and 3.5 feet tall at the shoulder, but they can reach heights of over 4 feet sometimes as well. They grow between 7 and 10 feet long. All in all, rhinos have a significant size advantage. Grizzly Bear vs. Rhino Speed Grizzly bears and rhinos are both large animals that know how to get around in a hurry. On average, grizzly bears can reach a top speed of about 35 mph. However, rhinos can charge at about 34 mph, roughly the same speed as a grizzly despite being many times heavier than them. The grizzly bear may have a very small advantage in speed. Grizzly Bear vs. Rhino Defenses The rhino is known for having very stout defenses. The animal has thick layers of skin that are two inches thick and composed of two layers of collagen. This protective hide can turn the bites of predators into a nuisance, not allowing them to penetrate deeply enough to do serious harm. Moreover, the rhino is fast and powerful, so bringing it down is tough. Grizzly bears also have a lot of raw power that makes them difficult to prey upon. Furthermore, theyâre known for their thick fur, skin, and layers of fat that offer them protection against bites and other attacks. However, their flesh isnât as protective as a rhinoâs. Rhinos have a defensive advantage in this battle. Grizzly Bear vs. Rhino Offensive Capabilities Rhinos have a fair amount of offensive power despite being herbivores. The rhinos that have horns can put them to use at the end of a charge to impale enemies. These horns can measure between 8 and 30 inches most of the time, but they can get even longer. All rhinos can use their immense body weight and power to knock enemies over and trample them to death. Grizzly bears have a multifaceted attack pattern. They maul their prey. That usually includes biting with 975 PSI of power, driving 3inch canines and 1inch teeth into their prey over and over again while swatting them with their paws and slashing them with claws. Grizzlies are known for biting prey on the back and neck, bringing it to the ground before finishing it off. Although their attack methods are unique, both animals have highly effective offensive powers. Grizzly Bear vs. Rhino Predatory Behavior Although the grizzly bear is not highly predatory, it still has the advantage over a rhino. outdoorsmanShutterstock.com The average grizzly bear is not a highly predatory creature. They usually seek their food through scavenging efforts or by gathering. However, they do have a prey drive. These animals donât ambush prey in the same way that a stalking tiger does. Grizzly bears try to use the element of surprise to start the hunt, and they ultimately chase their prey and wear it down with brutal attacks. Meanwhile, rhinos do not have any predatory behaviors.",
            "Moreover, grizzly bears have sharp claws and teeth that they use to tear through their prey, while rhinos rely solely on their horns for protection and offensive means. Grizzly bears are well adapted to various climates, including mountainous and coastal areas. Conversely, rhinos prefer living in tropical or subtropical climates, as they are less tolerant of cold temperatures. So, where the fight occurs may make a difference in who emerges victorious at the end of the day. There are many differences between grizzly bears and rhinos, which makes determining which would win a fight difficult. The battles outcome relies on many variables size, strength, agility, experience, and environment. Key Factors in a Fight Between a Grizzly Bear and a Rhinoceros Every fight is different, and many factors can affect the outcome. Size, speed, aggression, and defense mechanisms vary between species and individuals, so its impossible to say with certainty which animal would win a fight between a grizzly bear and a rhinoceros without seeing them in action. And hopefully, no one will have to witness such a gruesome fight Grizzly Bear vs. Rhino Size Grizzly bears usually weigh between 400 to 900 pounds and stand 3 to 5 feet tall. Lubos ChlubnyShutterstock.com The rhinoceros has a clear size advantage over the grizzly bear in a fight. The average adult rhino can weigh between 3,000 and 8,000 pounds and stands 4 to 6 feet high at the shoulder, while grizzly bears usually weigh between 400 to 900 pounds and stand 3 to 5 feet tall. The size difference can be seen even in the length of each animal. On average, rhinos grow 11 to 15 feet long, while grizzly bears typically reach 7 to 10 feet. Of course, there are always exceptions to these averages, with some rhinos reaching a weight of 9,000 pounds and grizzly bears growing as large as 1,200 pounds Regarding protection from attacks, the size of a rhino gives them an obvious advantage. Their thick skin is difficult to penetrate, and their large horns are powerful when defending themselves against predators. Grizzly Bear vs. Rhino Speed When it comes to speed, bears are eversoslightly faster than rhinos. A grizzly bear can achieve a top running speed of around 35 miles per hour, whereas an adult black rhino typically achieves 25 to 34 miles per hour. And an adult white rhino tends to be a bit slower, reaching only a top speed of 31 miles per hour. Grizzly bears can climb trees and swim in rivers, giving them an advantage in terms of mobility. Rhinos cannot compete with this level of agility due to their sheer size. Bears have muscular legs that give them the power to maintain their speed over long distances, even if the terrain is hilly or challenging. This difference in speed and agility gives bears an advantage over rhinos regarding endurance. So, the longer the fight, the better chance the grizzly may have against the mighty rhino. Grizzly Bear vs. Rhino Aggression An adult white rhino can reach 31 miles per hour. Chris TwineShutterstock.com The grizzly bear is an apex predator known for being aggressive when protecting their cubs. They can also be very territorial, especially during mating season. They attack humans when provoked or if their food source is threatened. The rhinos natural instinct is to flee from danger rather than fight, but they can become highly aggressive if provoked or threatened. When angered, a rhino will forcefully charge its opponent and use its horns to defend itself. Female rhinos with young calves are incredibly aggressive and will use their horns to protect their offspring at all costs. Grizzly Bear vs. Rhino Defense Mechanisms Rhinos have thick skin that is difficult to penetrate and long horns that can be used to defend themselves. Bears rely more heavily on their claws and teeth for defense in a fight. Bears are also known for their ability to stand up on two feet to gain a height advantage against predators and potential attackers. While the grizzly bearโs natural defense mechanisms are effective, they cannot compare to the rhinos natural guards, making it difficult to wage a successful fight against rhinos. Grizzly Bear vs. Rhino Offensive Capabilities Rhinos have the physical strength to push and shove with their horns, which can be deadly if they can unbalance or knock down their opponent. On the other hand, bears fight with claws and teeth, making them better suited for closerange combat but less effective when engaging in longrange battles. Both animals use their physical strength and unique abilities to protect themselves while taking down potential threats."

            "And remember that A Good Day to Die Hard has yet to open in several top markets, e.g., France, Brazil, and Australia. Die Hard movies budget And finally, heres another set of comparisons the Die Hard movies budgets. Die Hard cost 28 million approx. 54 million today. Die Hard 2 Die Harder cost 70 million approx. 123 million today. Die Hard With a Vengeance cost 90 million approx. 136 million today. Live Free or Die Hard cost 110 million approx. 122 million today. A Good Day to Die Hard cost 92 million. To match the original Die Hard s budgettoboxoffice ratio, A Good Day to Die Hard would have to gross 273 million at the North American box office. To match Live Free or Die Hard s ratio, Bruce Willis latest Die Hard movie would have to earn 113 million domestically. At this stage, 113 million looks only slightly more attainable than 273 million. Well see. A Good Day to Die Hard cast In addition to Bruce Willis, A Good Day to Die Hard features Jai Courtney as John McClanes son, Jack McClane, plus Sebastian Koch, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Cole Hauser, Yuliya Snigir, Radivoje Bukvic, and Amaury Nolasco. Among director John Moores previous credits are the Mark Wahlberg flop thriller Max Payne , and the remakes The Omen , with Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles, and The Flight of the Phoenix , with Dennis Quaid and Tyrese Gibson. A Good Day to Die Hard Bruce Willis as John McClane photo 20th Century Fox. Melissa McCarthy in Identity Thief . Melissa McCarthy Identity Thief overperforms Steven Soderbergh Side Effects disappoints Box office Feb. 9 Starring Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman, the Seth Gordondirected comedy Identity Thief grossed an estimated 11.2 million at 3,141 theaters on Friday, according to figures found at Box Office Mojo. Thats considerably above expectations. As a result, instead of earning around 25 million over the weekend as some pundits had predicted, Identity Thief is on its way to something closer to 33m35 million, depending on the aftereffects of winter storm Nemo, which just hit the U.S. northeast. Image Melissa McCarthy Identity Thief . For comparisons sake Seth Gordons Horrible Bosses , featuring an ensemble cast that included Jason Bateman, Jennifer Aniston , and Colin Farrell , opened with 9.9 million on its first day out in July 2011. Paul Feig s Bridesmaids , another ensemble comedy featuring eventual Best Supporting Actress Academy Award nominee Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig , and Maya Rudolph, debuted with 7.8 million in May 2011 . And the Jason Bateman Ryan Reynolds comedy The ChangeUp debuted with a mere 4.8 million in August 2011. Horrible Bosses went on to gross 28.3 million over its debut weekend, cuming at 117.5 million in North America and 209.6 million worldwide. Bridesmaids raked in 26.3 million on its opening weekend, reaching 169.1 million domestically and 288.4 million worldwide. In both cases, the two broad comedies performed quite a bit better in the U.S. and Canada than internationally expect much the same trajectory for Identity Thief . A box office bomb in North America, The ChangeUp brought in only 37.1 million domestically, in addition to a slightly better 38.4 million overseas for a grand worldwide total of 75.5 million. To date, the best 2013 weekend debut belongs to the Jessica Chastain horror thriller Mama , which grossed 28.4 million in midJanuary. Note Mama had the advantage of Martin Luther King Days Monday holiday, which surely helped to boost attendance at Sunday evening shows. Either way, Identity Thief should easily surpass Mama s box office booty. Identity Thief Heights of laziness and idiocy As the saying goes, If you offer audiences good movies, theyll flock to your theaters. Salon.com s Andrew OHehir might disagree with that statement. In his Identity Thief review, OHehir wrote Considering that it starts out with two distinctive and likable stars and a reasonably promising premise, Identity Thief reaches impressive heights of laziness and idiocy. According to reports, the Melissa McCarthyJason Bateman combo performed particularly well in whats called the American Heartland  for those in denial, that is. After all, if the U.S. has a pulse, its to be found in its urban centers. Anyhow, whether New York City is the U.S.",

The duo has combined for nine NBA titles, and James is still in a position to add to that total in the coming years. As incredible as their nine rings are, however, its not nearly as impressive as winning 10 titles alone. Thats exactly what this Boston Celtics legend did in his 12year NBA career. And no, it wasnt Bill Russell. Michael Jordan and LeBron James have combined for nine NBA titles Michael Jordan and LeBron James are No. 1 and No. 2 in the NBA GOAT debate not just because of their skill, but because of their prolific championship resumes. Jordans championship success is well known across the basketball community. The Chicago legend won all six of his NBA Finals appearances, solidifying him as one of the alltime great winners in league history. He led the Bulls to two separate threepeats during the 1990s. James has only half the number of titles Jordan owns, but his playoff resume is still one of the greatest ever. The former Cavaliers and Heat star has made it to nine NBA Finals in his career. Although he only won three championships in those nine appearances, James ability to lead a team to its greatest potential is unmatched. Boston Celtics legend Sam Jones won more NBA titles than Jordan and James combined If you think Michael Jordan and LeBron James have impressive postseason resumes, wait until you hear about Sam Jones. The Celtics legend played 12 seasons in the NBA and won an unprecedented 10 championships, more than Jordan and James combined. Jones was an integral part of the Celtics dynasty throughout the 1950s and 60s. Bill Russell gets the most credit for Bostons incredible sustained success, but Jones should be a close second. Over the course of his career, Jones averaged 17.7 points per game. He served as the teams sharpshooter and playmaking guard for over a decade. He made five AllStar teams and three AllNBA Second Teams, but his championship resume is by far his most impressive feat. After his rookie season ended without a title, Jones and the Celtics rattled off eight consecutive championship seasons. Boston failed to win the 196667 title, but they bounced back to win the next two. Jones finished his career with enough rings to fit on all of his fingers at once. Sam Jones was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1983 NBAFinals AllTime Field Goals Congrats to LeBron James, who just passed Sam Jones, 10time NBA Champ with the celtics , for third place pic.twitter.comtleZFtO1Ww  NBA History NBAHistory June 13, 2017 Sam Jones might not garner the same respect Bill Russell gets for propelling the Celtics dynasty, but Boston doesnt win 10 titles in 12 years without him. Jones scored over 15,000 points in his illustrious career. He averaged over 20 points in four straight seasons during the 1960s, leading the team in scoring in all four years. Jones was ahead of his time in terms of his scoring ability. He had the Tim Duncan bank shot perfected before Duncan was even born. He could run the floor like a deranged Russell Westbrook in his prime. His midrange jumper rivals that of Iso Joe Johnsons. Jones finished his career with the secondmost NBA titles in league history. Russell is still the only player ahead of him with 11 championships. Jones was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1983.",

LeBron grew up idolizing MJ. He dressed like him, wore his shoes, and studied his play style. Once he joined the league, he even donned the number 23. LeBron appeared in his eighth straight NBA Finals series in 2018. He has 10 in total and now holds a record of 46. Jordan, as we all know, has six rings in six appearances. Oftentimes, the rings argument is what puts MJ ahead of LeBron in debates on who is the GOAT. However, rings shouldnt carry that much weight. If they did, the greatest player ever would be Bill Russell, who won 11 championships in his 13year career. Who is considered the GOAT of basketball is important because of the impact one player can have on the game. Unlike football, where 53 men play, basketball teams can be completely changed by one man. In order to end this debate of whos the greatest, one needs to look at the key factors that would determine who the greatest of all time is. LeBron Sports Illustrated Cover Jordan and James Career Accolades LeBron James Michael Jordan Advantage Future Hall of Famer Hall of Famer Equal 4x NBA Champion 46 Finals Record 6x NBA Champion 60 Finals Record Jordan 4x NBA Final MVP 6x NBA Finals MVP Jordan 4x MVP 5x MVP Jordan 19x AllStar 14x All Star James 18x All NBA Team 11x All NBA Team James 6x All Defensive Player 9x All Defensive Player 8788 Defensive Player of the Year Jordan 0304 Rookie of the Year 8485 Rookie of the Year Equal Michael Jordan Trophies Why Michael Jordan Is the GOAT Currently, Jordan holds a lead in all accolades minus Rookie of the Year, AllStar appearances, AllNBA Team, and Hall of Fame. He has a better Finals record as well with two more rings than LeBron. He also has three more AllDefense selections and one more MVP award. He also has a Defensive Player of the Year award, an accomplishment that has eluded James. While LeBron has a way to go, his dominance to acquire his fourth ring has made him even closer to capturing his goal of six or more rings.

While Jordan scored more overall, LeBron is a more efficient player, shooting better from two and threepoint range. LeBron is also a much better passer and rebounder than Jordan ever was. MJ has a much better free throw percentage, which helps to bolster that points per game statistic. The two are almost even in efficiency ratings, with Michael being first overall in NBA history, and LeBron trailing slightly at second. Michael averaged more steals per game, but both players are dead even in blocks per game."

Soundtracks Finger Written by Steve Ernie Jones  Sylvain Fournier Performed by Ernie With an Attitude User reviews 3 Review Review Featured review 2  10 Disappointing on so many levels. Canadian television usually provides good viewing and I had high expectations for this one. It had a storyline and plot that had the potential to be filled with intrigue and suspense. Unfortunately it was disappointing on almost every levelthe character development, the script, the development of the storyline and the acting. I would sum it up as being totally unfulfilling and not living up to the premise and expectation that it created Geneviève Bujold stars as Suzanne St Laurent, a high flying lawyer with a record of success and a relationship with her daughter that has its problems although thankfully they have the sense not to overdramatize it in the fashion that so many over TV movies do. As a character Suzanne St Laurent is unconvincing, weak, onedimensional and not very convincing. This may not have been Bujolds fault her script and character development details do not give her much to go on in portraying her character but you dont feel anything for her character as she undergoes the ordeal of being held hostage in her own apartment with her daughter facing the prospect of death. And it shouldnt be like that a good script makes you able to feel sympathy, emotion and sometimes pain for what the character is going through. This movie made me feel extremely cold toward the main heroine.",

During the trial, a secret affair from Rustys recent past threatens to hamper his defense and fracture his relationship with his son.

While Sabich was not convicted, his innocence was not really established. So Tommy Molto, the man who prosecuted Sabich is looking for another chance at him. Sabichs wife died and it appears that she may have committed suicide but Molto assistant wants to investigate and he discovers circumstantial evidence that points to Sabich. It seems like Sabich was having an affair and his wife, who killed his mistress, was suspecting him of it which he denies. So Sabich calls Sandy Stern the man who defended him the last time to defend him again.  rcs0411yahoo.com Sixtyone year old Rozat Sabich  more often called Rusty even in formal circumstances  is the chief appellate court judge of Kindle County, Illinois. He is in an unhappy marriage to Barbara Sabich, who suffers from medically diagnosed psychiatric issues for which she taking an array of prescription medications.

One day, Barbara is found dead in her bed, Rusty, the person discovering the body, who did not report it to the authorities for 24 hours. The official cause of death is listed as natural causes, specifically heart failure. Because of the case twenty years ago, Jimmy Brand, Tommys assistant, cant help but believe that Rusty murdered Barbara. Tommy, however, feels he cannot openly attack Rusty again, but allows Jimmy to investigate on his own on the QT. Jimmy does eventually discover enough evidence for Rusty to be charged with murder. Rusty once again retains his old friend Sandy Stern to defend him, he who tried and won the case twenty years ago. Some information that does come to light to a select group, including Sandy and Nat, is that Rusty did have an affair as recently as a year ago, Rusty who feels that the identity of the woman not important due to the affair having ended several months before Barbaras death. Regardless of the truth, what happens at the trial may come down to the priorities each of the major players has.  Huggo Synopsis It looks like we dont have any synopsis for this title yet.

However, without the great individuals of the game, there is no doubt that many of the greatest club seasons in the world would not be possible. From goalscoring strikers and assisting midfielders to stonecold defenders and goalkeepers, they all have had their moments in the sun. With that thought in mind, we pay tribute to the best individual performances to conserve throughout the multiple elite ages. Telmo Zarra 195051 1 of 50 Athletic Bilbao legend Telmo Zarra held the singleseason goalscoring record for decades in Spain. During the 195051 campaign, the Basque native scored 38 league goals and 46 in total across all competitions. Filippo Inzaghi 200203 2 of 50 Filippo Inzaghi had a host of amazing seasons during his long and successful career. However, his best season ever was in 200203when he returned 30 goals in all competitions. Raul 200001 3 of 50 Real Madrid and Spanish legend Raul rose to the occasion in 200001, scoring 32 goals in 50 appearances for the Whites. Despite his best season being over a decade ago, he continues to prolong his career with more success now with Al Sadd in Qatar. Marco Van Basten 198687 4 of 50 In his last year with Dutch Eredivisie side Ajax Amsterdam, Marco van Basten scored 45 goals in 44 appearances. The talented Netherlands striker would move on to AC Milan and continue his success, but never reached those goalscoring heights again. Johan Cryuff 196667 5 of 50 Johan Cruyff reached the summit of his scoring abilities during his time with Ajax, when he scored 41 goals in 41 games during the 196667 season. An attacking midfielder scoring that many goals had truly been unheard of until the days of the Dutch master. Robin Van Persie 201112 6 of 50 Former Arsenal striker Robin van Persie now with Manchester United hit the prime of his career in his 201112 campaign for the Gunners. The then28yearold striker scored 37 goals in 48 appearances for the club, but it still wasnt enough to get Arsenal to the summit of the English Premier League. Fernando Torres 200708 7 of 50 Chelsea striker Fernando Torres has a great history of scoring goals. Unfortunately for his current club, that history came and apparently stayed at Liverpool. His debut campaign in the English Premier League in 200708 saw the young Spanish hitman score 33 goals in 46 games. Wayne Rooney 200910 8 of 50 Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney still has many years left, but he may have made his most masterful one the 200910 campaign for the Red Devils. The Liverpoolborn forward scored 34 goals in 44 games to nearly lead his club to another title. Radamel Falcao 201011 9 of 50 Although last season was outstanding for the Colombian international at Atletico Madrid, his previous campaign at FC Porto in 201011 was even more impressive. Falcao notched 38 goals in 42 appearances for the Dragons and earned his massive move to Spain, where he is once again threatening to have a huge season this year. Gunnar Nordahl 195051 10 of 50 Swedish and AC Milan legend Gunnar Nordahl still holds the record for the most goals in a single season for the Milanese Reds. He scored 38 across all competitions for the club as they went on to claim the Serie A title in 195051. Didier Drogba 200910 11 of 50 Former Chelsea striker and Blues legend Didier Drogba was known for his ability to send his club to another level on the pitch. He was also capable of doing that with own skillsas he did in 200910, when he scored 37 goals and provided 12 assists in 42 games en route to an English Premier League title.",

            "The film stars Angelina Jolie as the title character, with Sharlto Copley , Elle Fanning , Sam Riley , Imelda Staunton , Juno Temple , and Lesley Manville in supporting roles. Maleficent came under development as an animated project in 2003, before it was changed to a liveaction feature in 2006, following Disney s acquisition of Pixar . Tim Burton was originally attached to direct the film, but eventually left and was replaced by Stromberg in his directorial debut . Jolie signed on to play the title role in January 2012 and also served as the films executive producer, alongside Michael Vieira, Don Hahn , Palak Patel, Matt Smith, and Sarah Bradshaw. 3 The rest of the main cast joined between March and May 2012. Principal photography took place at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire , England , from June to October 2012. Maleficent premiered in Los Angeles on May 28, 2014, and was released in the United States theatrically on May 30 by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures . It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Jolies performance, visual effects and costumes, with criticism aimed at the script and inconsistencies in tone.

Plot  edit  Maleficent is a powerful fairy living in the Moors, a magical forest realm bordering a human kingdom. As a child, she meets a human peasant boy named Stefan , and they fall in love with each other. However, as they get older, the two grow apart, with Stefans love being overshadowed by his ambition to be a king, while Maleficent becomes the protector of the Moors. When King Henry, the ruler of the human kingdom, attempts to conquer the Moors, Maleficent mortally wounds him, forcing his retreat. On his deathbed, Henry declares that whoever kills Maleficent will be named his successor and marry his daughter Leila. Stefan visits Maleficent in the Moors and drugs her, but cannot bring himself to kill her. He instead cuts off her wings, presenting them to Henry as proof of her death. While still processing the betrayal, Maleficent saves Diaval , a trapped raven , from being killed by a farmer by turning him into a human. Diaval offers her his service, and brings her news of Stefans coronation. Furious to learn why her wings were taken, Maleficent, and the Moors she protects, becomes dark and bitter. Some time later, Diaval informs Maleficent about the christening of Stefans newborn daughter, Aurora . Maleficent arrives uninvited and curses the infant princess, declaring that by her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into an eternal sleep. Maleficent mocks Stefans plea for mercy, but offers an antidote  the curse can be broken by true loves kiss, which she and Stefan both believe does not exist.

Advertisement The 38yearold admitted she didnt set out for Vivienne to be an actor. However, Vivienne was the only child actor she could find who wasnt terrified of her in costume. Angelina told Entertainment Weekly magazine We think its fun for our kids to have cameos and join us on set, but not to be actors. Thats not our goal, for Brad and I, at all. But the other 3 and 4yearold performers wouldnt come near me. It had to be a child that liked me and wasnt afraid of my horns and my eyes and my claws. So it had to be Viv. Angelina wears prothetic cheekbones and horns to play Sleeping Beautys nemesis. Even her son Pax, 10, was scared. More like this She said When Pax saw me for the first time, he ran away and got upset  and I thought he was kidding, so I was pretending to chase him until I actually found him crying. After the initial scare, Pax recovered enough to star as an extra with his sister Zahara, 8. I had to walk by them being very mean, Angelina explained. Of course, I wanted to stop and wink at them. Angelina and Brad also have children Maddox, 12, Shiloh, 7 and Viviennes twin Knox.

Gijsbert HanekrootRedfernsGetty Unless theres yet another leg waiting to be announced, the Eagles wrapped up their twoyear History of the Eagles tour this week with a show at CenturyLink Center in Bossier City, Louisiana. The hugely successful tour saw them presenting their catalog in chronological order, including an opening set with guitarist Bernie Leadon, who hadnt toured with since he left the band in 1975. They played all sorts of songs they hadnt touched in many years, including Saturday Night, DoolinDalton and Train Leaves Here This Morning. In honor of the tour coming to a close, we asked our readers to select their favorite Eagles songs. Here are the results. Peaceful Easy Feeling Jack Tempchin was a young singersongwriter gigging around the San Diego coffee house scene when he wrote a little ode to carefree living and new love that caught the ear of Glenn Frey right as the Eagles were first coming together. In a decision with huge ramifications for Tempchins financial future, the Eagles covered it on their debut album. It was the third single from their 1972 debut LP, and it reached Number 22 on the Hot 100. Today, many people remember the song as the tune playing in the Dudes cab in The Big Lebowski . When he complains that he hates the fucking Eagles the cabbie immediately throws him out. Theyre mellow, but the Eagles remain a highly divisive band. Wasted Time Don Henley went through a bitter breakup with interior designer and future jewelry designer Loree Rodkin shortly before the band began work on Hotel California . He poured all his heartache and regret into Wasted Time. I could have done so many things, baby, he sings. If I could only stop my mind from wonderin what I left behindAnd from worrying bout this wasted time. The mournful ballad complete with strings ends the first side of the album and a symphonic reprise kicks off side two. It was never a single, but fans loved it and it was a highlight of the bands Hell Freezes Over reunion album in 1994. I Cant Tell You Why Bassist Timothy B. Schmit joined the Eagles shortly before they began their long and grueling work on 1979s The Long Run . He presented a very rough version of I Cant Tell You Why to Don Henley and Glenn Frey, who helped him flesh it out into a song that dominated the airwaves in the spring of 1980. Schmit didnt have much time to celebrate. The group broke up just months later, but it gave him a huge song to sing on future tours with Ringo Starr and his All Starr Band. Its been his spotlight song at every gig since the Eagles reformed 21 years ago. Lyin Eyes The Eagles were a pretty popular band before they released One of these Nights in the summer of 1975, but that album brought them to a whole other level of success. It was their first LP to reach Number One on the Billboard album chart, and the singles were all over the radio. Lyin Eyes was written by Don Henley and Glenn Frey one night when they saw a young couple talking and imagined they were in the middle of a secret affair. It hit Number Two on the Hot 100. It seemed like the band couldnt get any more popular, but nobody knew what they had planned for 1976. One of These Nights The first two Eagles albums were produced by Glyn Johns, but he saw the band primarily as a countryrock act.",

Picture Getty By Tom Eames The Eagles were one of the biggest bands of the 1970s, thanks to their sweet sound that mixed soft rock, country and folk. In a relatively short space of time, they became one of the worlds most popular groups, and they have two of the three biggestselling albums in US history. Despite a severe breakup in the 1980s, they later reunited and continue to perform to sold out crowds across the world. Here are our top 10 picks for the perfect Eagles soundtrack Life in the Fast Lane Life in the Fast Lane 2013 Remaster Recorded for the Hotel California album, this song tells the story of a couple that takes their excessive lifestyle to the very edge. Glenn Frey later revealed that the title came to him when he was riding on the freeway with a drug dealer known as The Count. He asked the dealer to slow down and his reply was What do you mean Its life in the fast lane. Take it To the Limit Eagles  Take It To The Limit Live.... Randy Meisner, who sings lead vocals on this song, began writing it as his solo composition. As it remained unfinished when the time came for the One of These Nights album to be recorded, Don Henley and Glenn Frey helped Meisner in finishing it. However, disputes over his reluctance to perform the song live would later directly lead to Meisners departure from the band. Peaceful Easy Feeling Peaceful Easy Feeling 2013 Remaster One of the Eagles first hits, songwriter Jack Tempchin penned the song when he was performing at folk coffee shops around his hometown of San Diego. A friend had created a poster to advertise his gigs, which included fake quotes from famous stars. He wrote an early version of Peaceful Easy Feeling on the back of a poster, and some time later was attempting to break into the music industry when Glenn Frey heard the song, and asked if he could use it for his new band, which had only just formed eight days before. He gave Tempchin a cassette demo on the track the next day, who later said It was so good I couldnt believe it. Seven Bridges Road Seven Bridges Road Live 2013 Remaster Steve Young first recorded this song on his 1969 album Rock Salt  Nails , but its bestknown version is a fivepart harmony cover by English musician Iain Matthews, later recorded by Eagles in 1980. Matthews recorded it in 1973, and Eagles later borrowed the arrangement. When the band began playing stadiums, the group would warm up by singing the song in a locker room shower area . After, each concert would then open with the groups five members singing it a capella into a single microphone. Amazing harmonies on Eagles  Seven Bridges Road Don Felder said it blew the audience away. It was always a vocally unifying moment, all five voices coming together in harmony.This version was recorded at their concert at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. Young later said I didnt like the Eagles version at first. But the more I hear it, the better it sounds. Tequila Sunrise Eagles  Tequila Sunrise Live From Melbourne Official Video 4K Glenn Frey and Don Henley didnt write songs together for their debut album, and they decided they should work together for the followup, Desperado . According to Frey, he was lying on a sofa playing the guitar, and came up with a guitar riff he described as kinda Roy Orbison, kinda Mexican. He showed Henley the riff and said Maybe we should write something to this. The songs title refers to a popular cocktail named Tequila Sunrise. Take it Easy Eagles  Take It Easy Live on MTV 1994 Official Video HD This was the Eagles first ever single, and began life as a song by singersongwriter Jackson Browne, before Glenn Frey offered to finish the song for him. Browne later said After a couple of times when I declined to have him finish my song, I said, all right. I finally thought, This is ridiculous. Go ahead and finish it. Do it. And he finished it in spectacular fashion. And, whats more, arranged it in a way that was far superior to what I had written."

Updated Jan 12, 2022 Photo Jerritt ClarkGetty Images for Savage X Fenty Show Vol. 2 Presented by Amazon Prime Video 2000 Who Is Willow Smith Willow Smith grew up in the public eye as the daughter of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith . After acting in a few projects, in 2010 Smith released a song, Whip My Hair, that became a hit single. However, the demands of fame eventually stressed the young Smith to the point that she took a step away from performing. Smith later started making music as WILLOW. She overcame personal doubts and embraced her lifelong love of rock to release the album Lately I Feel Everything 2021. In doing so, she staked her own claim to a genre of music with strong ties to the Black community . In addition to music, Smith cohosts the popular talk show Red Table Talk with her mother and grandmother. Early Life and Family Willow Camille Reign Smith was born on October 31, 2000, in Los Angeles, California. Smith is the daughter of Hollywood stars Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. She has an older brother, Jaden Smith , and an older halfbrother, Trey Smith. Her familys status meant Smith was raised in the spotlight. Early Acting and Music In 2007, Smith had a role alongside her father in the movie I Am Legend . She next appeared in Kit Kittredge An American Girl 2008 and joined her mother to voice a character in Madagascar Escape 2 Africa 2008. She was also seen on the television show True Jackson, VP . As a teen, Smith performed vocally in Neo Yokio and Adventure Time . Smiths first pop single, Whip My Hair, came out when she was 9 years old. The song was a hit, ultimately going platinum and reaching No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2010, Smith signed a recording contract with JayZ s Roc Nation. Smith had some followup success with songs like 2011s 21st Century Girl, but nothing was as popular as Whip My Hair. She also came to dislike the pressurefilled lifestyle of performing. In 2012, Smith shaved her head during her Whip My Hair tour, an act of protest against continuing. She also decided she didnt want to take on the title role in a filmed version of the musical Annie that her father was producing. Smith has admitted she later started cutting herself in an attempt to deal with her emotional pain . Smith told Pinkett Smith in 2018, I definitely had to forgive you and Daddy for that whole Whip My Hair thing. It was mostly Daddy because he was so harsh at certain times. Reflecting on her childhood career, in 2019 she told People magazine, I was super young, and I had a dream, but all I really wanted to do was sing and I didnt equate that with all the business and the stress that ended up coming with it. Though shed rebelled against the demands on her, Smith didnt stop making music. Her debut album, Ardipithecus , was released in 2015. Her next two albums, The 1st and Willow , came out in 2017 and 2019 respectively. Red Table Talk Smith, her mother and her maternal grandmother, Adrienne BanfieldNorris, had a tradition of sharing personal stories and insights among themselves. Pinkett Smith recorded and released one of these nobarriers, intergenerational conversations in 2013. Five years later, the women launched their own talk show, Red Table Talk , on Facebook Watch. Red Table Talk has an informal setup that harkens back to the familys earlier discussions. On the show, the three generations of women have tackled topics such as mental health, politics and sexuality. In 2021, Smith shared that she was polyamorous. Salma Hayek , Kevin Hart , Olivia Jade Giannulli and Jordyn Woods are among some of the highprofile guests who have stopped by the program. In 2021, Red Table Talk won a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Informative Talk Show. Albums The Anxiety and Lately I Feel Everything The Anxiety , an indie rock album from Smith and partner Tyler Cole, came out in 2020."

Its sources are in the mountains in the southeast of the department of Santa Rosa . From there it flows past the town of Cuilapa through the coastal plains of Santa Rosa into the Laguna de Sipacate and then into the Pacific Ocean . 1 The Los Esclavos river basin covers a territory of 2,271 km² 877 sq ml. 2 Bridge  edit  Bridge over Los Esclavos river in 1897 3 A bridge was built over this river during the Spanish Colony, thanks to the initiative of Baltazar de Orena Note 1 from Valle Town Hall and governor Pedro Mayen de la Rueda, who proposed its construction in 1579. The bridge was completed in 1592 under the director of architects Francisco Tirado and Diego Felipe. 4 Years later, some repair were needed, and criollo poet and leader Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán was in charge of the work. 4 Note 2 Back in those days, all merchandise that came to Santiago de los Caballeros city, the capital city, came through Acajutla harbor, and the bridge was built to avoid the inconveniences that occurred whenever the river was too high. The bridge is 117 metres 128 yd long and 16 metres 18 yd across. 4 It was built above 11 arches 4 and, after almost 500 years, still stands in spite of the strong current and the earthquakes and storms that have damaged the rest of Guatemalan infrastructure.

Tom PenningtonGetty Images ESPN Stats  Information Apr 4, 2017, 1017 AM ET Email Print Tony Romo has decided to retire from football , according to league sources. Though the last two seasons of his career were shortened by injuries, Romo is among the best quarterbacks in Dallas Cowboys history, and one of the best undrafted quarterbacks ever. An impressive career Romo joined the Cowboys in 2003 and threw his first pass for the team during the 2006 season. Since then, he has become the franchises career leader in passing yards 34,183 and touchdown passes 248. His 248 passing touchdowns are the ninthmost in NFL history among quarterbacks who played their entire career with one team. Romo ranks third in quarterback wins in Cowboys history with 78, trailing Troy Aikman 94 and Roger Staubach 85. Romo has a career passer rating of 97.1, which is the fourthbest in NFL history minimum 1,000 pass attempts, trailing only Aaron Rodgers 104.1, Russell Wilson 99.6 and Tom Brady 97.2. Romo was signed an undrafted free agent. He ranks fourth in passing yards, third in touchdown passes and fourth in starts among undrafted players since 1970, according to Elias Sports Bureau research. Though Romo had an impressive regularseason career, his 248 passing touchdowns and 34,183 passing yards rank second and fourth, respectively, among players never to play in a conference championship game, according to Elias. What might have been In Romos first nine seasons since becoming Cowboys starting quarterback during the 2006 season, he started 123 of a possible 138 games. Over the past two seasons, Romo only started four of a possible 32 games. In the 2014 season, the last one in which he played the majority of his teams games, Romo was among the leagues most efficient passers. He led the NFL in Total QBR at 81.6, his career best not including his six snaps in 2016, and completion percentage 69.9 percent, best in a season in Cowboys history. He also led the NFL in passer rating 113.2 and yards per attempt 8.52 and was second in touchdowntointerception ratio 3.8 among qualified quarterbacks that season. Cool in the clutch ESPN Stats  Information From 200614, Romo led 27 gamewinning drives in the fourth quarter and overtime. That is the most in the NFL over that span, one more than Peyton Manning and Matt Ryan . From 200615, Romo completed 65 percent of his passes and averaged 8.4 yards per attempt in the fourth quarter, which is the best of any of the 36 passers with 500 action plays in the fourth quarter in that span."

El Salvador is a largely cash economy, where roughly 70 of people do not have bank accounts or credit cards.

Its value is derived, in part, from the fact that it is digitally scarce there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in existence. While details are still forthcoming about how the rollout will work, CNBC is told that El Salvador has assembled a team of bitcoin leaders to help build a new financial ecosystem with bitcoin as the base layer. Bukeles New Ideas party has control over the countrys Legislative Assembly, so passage of the bill is very likely. It was an inevitability, but here already the first country on track to make bitcoin legal tender, said Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream. Back said he plans to contribute technologies like Liquid and satellite infrastructure to make El Salvador a model for the world. Were pleased to help El Salvador on its journey towards adoption of the Bitcoin Standard, he said. This isnt El Salvadors first move into bitcoin. In March, Strike launched its mobile payments app there, and it quickly became the number one downloaded app in the country. Bukele has been very popular, with his populist New Ideas party sweeping recent elections. However, the new assembly recently came under fire after it ousted the attorney general and top judges. The move prompted the U.S. Agency for International Development to pull aid from El Salvadors national police and a public information institute, instead rerouting funds to civil society groups.

Much has been made in Britains music press of lead singer Chris Martins cleanliving ways and general distaste for alcohola far cry from the lifestyle of a stereotypical rock star.

At Coldplays official Web site, Martin further explained the bands reason for being We were trying to say that there is an alternative. That you can try to be catchy without being slick, poppy without being pop, and you can be uplifting without being pompous.... We wanted to be a reaction against soulless rubbish. The birth of a sensation The members of Coldplay met and became friends while living in the same dormitory at the University College of London UCL in the mid1990s.

The group comprises bassist Guy Berryman, guitarist Buckland, drummer Will Champion, and lead singer, guitarist, and pianist Martin. Martin had wanted to be a musician since the age of eleven. He explained to Katherine Turman of Mother Jones that when he began attending UCL, he was more interested in finding bandmates than in studying his major, ancient history. Asked by Turman whether he started his education thinking he would become an ancient history teacher, Martin jokingly responded, That was my real dream, but then Coldplay came about Three of the four members did complete their university education Berryman dropped out partway through, with much of their free time spent writing music and rehearsing.
